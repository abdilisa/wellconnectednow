                    <li>WCN <strong>Mentors</strong> are great for professionals  in the early stages of their frustrations, interested in some insider knowledge as they explore potential new roles. </li>
                    <li><strong>Coaches</strong> are better for those feeling more unsure about what next steps to take, but still eager for change. Also great for Founders looking for trustworthy business advice outside of their team and investors, that doesn't have a conflict of interest. </li>
                    <li>For more prolonged dissatisfaction, WCN <strong>Therapists</strong> are professionally trained to respond to your more persistent challenges in ways that can reframe your negative self-talk and help you address your core concerns.</li>

                <div class="faq-item-text">Mentors  don't volunteer for the money, so please consider the $25/match your contribution to our growing WCN community. We'll gift your mentor a $10 gift-card as a special thanks for their time, and invest the remaining $15 in events where you two can casually re-connect down the line.

                <div class="faq-item-text">Coaches typically bill an average $200/hour given their 5+ years industry experience and pre-book 1-3 months of sessions at a time. This can get pricey since they aren't covered by insurance, but could also be very worth it. Some employers may also subsidize your costs. <br> WCN's referral rate is only 15% and covered by our coaches.

                <div class="faq-item-text">Therapists typically bill an average $150/session. If you have insurance though, therapists may be the most affordable option for you, with average co-pays below $40/session.  Please note many of the best therapists are moving out-of-network, and can still be covered by a Health Savings Account or subsidized by your insurance.

					<h2 class="section-heading text-center">Founding Story</h2>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="mission-text col-md-6">
							<p>There are more depressed & anxious millennials today than we’ve seen in any other generation.</p>
							<p>Even more alarmingly, more than 70% of the 25 million professionals struggling with depression & anxiety today aren’t seeking treatment.</p>
							<p>Could that change if they heard about cognitive-behavioral talk therapy's 80% effectiveness rates?</p>
							<p>After studying  Psychology & Science, Technology & Society at Stanford, coaching Microsoft's Academy of College Hires, and marketing consumer apps around the world as a Tech Evangelist, Lisa Abdilova saw too many friends, co-workers, and mentees struggle with unsupportive managers and underwhelming roles.</p>
							<p>Blind referrals from doctors, difficulties scheduling, and incompatible matches have also made finding help unnecessarily harder for too many people in vulnerable times.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="mission-text col-md-6">
							<p>Although  influencers from the Economist,  the Atlantic, YCombinator, and beyond have raised awareness on the importance of managing your psychology and fighting the stigma around mental health, professionals and aspiring founders still don't know how to recognize depression or anxiety, or which specialists can help reframe their negative self-talk.</p>
							<p>Turns out that only 18% of therapists actually market their services directly to professionals, which explains why the nuances and benefits of therapy haven't yet been messaged well enough for people to realize what they're missing.</p>
							<p>If mental health could be approached as a marketing problem, surely this broken customer journey  could be re-designed to make professional support more appealing and accessible, especially for those with highly treatable, mild to moderate depression and anxiety.</p>
