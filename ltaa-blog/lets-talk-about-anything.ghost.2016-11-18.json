to Ghost","slug":"welcome-to-ghost","markdown":"You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing.

WCN (wellconnectednow.com) is a service that personally matches professionals to mentors, coaches, and therapists. Lisa has been working on the venture for about year and a half now, and spoke candidly to us about everything from the hunt for her co-founder, to revenue milestones, to the support system who helped her take the plunge.\n\nGrowing up in the Bay Area and attending Stanford University as an undergraduate, Lisa grew up in a hotbed of entrepreneurship: “I think like a lot of twenty- and thirty-somethings do these days, I wanted to be involved with starting a business from the ground up. I wanted to create a household brand,” she said.\n\nBoth of Lisa’s parents worked in the technology space in San Francisco, and laid some initial groundwork for Lisa’s entrepreneurial pursuit. “I distinctly remember my parents coming home from work…frustrated…and [saying] ‘you need to be your own boss one day,’” she said.\n\nIn addition to her parents, a former manager at Bling — a mobile payments company — really inspired Lisa to consider her own venture. This role model, who helped launch E*TRADE, spoke about the valuable experiences she gained in the entrepreneurial process: learning rapidly, and working with people who shared the same passion. “Those were all things that I wanted,” said Lisa. “[And] it was with her stamp of approval and encouragement that I went for it [with WCN]. I went all-in.”\n\nShe does admit that “all-in” didn’t mean a full-time pursuit until a meeting with another advisor, Nate Rodland, the COO of Robinhood.\n“Nate said to me, ‘There’s no f*cking way you can build a high-growth startup while working another job full-time,’” she explained.\n\nSo, in November of 2014, Lisa left her role as a Product Marketing Manager at Microsoft to pursue WCN full-time. Without a steady salary, Lisa realized that she’d need to find support via other means. “I got a really small loan from friends and family,” she said. “You really don’t need much.”\n\nLisa had already been thinking about the concept of WCN for about a year. “It was a long-time in the making. I just saw too many people who had been struggling, and I know how effective therapy can be for people,” she said. “I also know that therapists and coaches can give a lot of priceless knowledge and encouragement to people in tough times.\n\n>*“I wish that there was more of a resource that people could call when their manager isn’t treating them right or they just got a bad review. I want people to have a place that they can call and get trustworthy support, wherever they are on the spectrum of dissatisfaction — whether that’s them wanting a new role or wanting to get their life together, or whether it’s getting a little darker than that.”*\n\nAt Microsoft, Lisa found avenues to explore these passions, coaching mentees from the Microsoft Academy of College Hires, but wanted to pursue the problem of mental health more aggressively. “It didn’t feel like enough,” she said. “70% of people struggling with depression and anxiety don’t seek treatment today. My dream is that one day, that percentage will be significantly lower, and that we can say that WCN had a direct impact in lowering that number.”\n\n![Lisa Abdilova’s first mental health advocacy campaign at Stanford #FightTheStigma](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZwyxU31-wZXHeegrSBM1GQ.jpeg)\n\nLisa graduated with a degree in Psychology and Science, Technology, and Society from Stanford in 2011. She relies a great deal on her degree in building out partnerships for her venture: “As I schmooze with all of these therapists, it really helps that I can walk the walk and quote different studies and recognize the big-name therapists,” she said. However, Science, Technology, and Society is not a degree in Computer Science, which accounted for a skill gap in Lisa’s plan to run her business through an online storefront. “They always tell you to find a partner,” she said. “Any tech blog or any accelerator will encourage you to have a co-founder, especially if you’re not a developer.”\n\nWhile conducting the search for a co-founder, Lisa enrolled in a web design course through General Assembly to keep her plan in motion. And despite searching for a partner for six months, had trouble landing the perfect co-founder. Lisa recollected Nate’s assessment of her search: “At this point, we’re over six months in. The idea is running. The website’s up. You have clients in…\n\n###“You’re a solo founder whether you like it or not.”\nAlthough there have been some technical hurdles for Lisa, she feels confident in her role as a solo founder, particularly when thinking about company ownership. Having dedicated over a year of her life to this project, the concept of handing significant equity to someone who hasn’t been along for the journey feels backwards. “It’s not about credit, it’s about the mission,” she said. “[But] it’s not fair if one person is doing significantly more work than the other.”\nWe dug into this more toward the end of our interview. When posed with the question “if you had to do it all over again, what would you change?” Lisa’s response pivoted around getting the right people invested and onboard before taking the plunge: “I would gather my team first, and leave all together. It’s hard being the first person to start a company, and it’s really hard to be the second person to decide to join.”\nTruth be told, Lisa is not completely solo in her venture. She is supported by a team of six advisors with whom she has formalized contracts and advising terms. “The goal was for each advisor to supplement my skill set,” she said. Her mix of advisors ranges from former employers (“They know what you’re capable of.”), to more seasoned entrepreneurs (“They just know exactly what you need to know and how to do it.”), to technical and telehealth professionals. Lisa shared a piece of advice that someone had formerly given her when figuring out who to team up with:\n“With investors and advisors, if they called you, would you want to pick up?”\nIn addition to leveraging her advisors’ knowledge, Lisa explained that she’s learning on her own at an incredibly rapid pace. “[The reality of the entrepreneurial experience is that] something comes up that you have to figure out. And you have the opportunity — because you dictate your own time — to spend the next day reading everything you possibly can about it,” she said. “And then you get to put what you learn into motion. Or you find people to help you fill in the gaps or clarify the things you don’t understand. You really do learn a ridiculous amount.”\nTo supplement her background in marketing, Lisa enrolled in a program that matches entrepreneurs with Stanford business school students, who help build out business plans and advise on fundraising strategy. After three months of meetings, Lisa had a 20-page plan, complete with financial models, which she sent along to her advisors. Her advisors thought the document was comical — no one reads 20-page documents anymore — and suggested that she turn the information into a pitch deck and an executive summary (code for a well-designed flier, which Lisa later learned). A marketing intern also helped Lisa perform SWOT analysis, and identify different competitors in the space. Indirect competitors (who are getting the largest amount of funding) are establishing business-to-business telehealth offerings, setting up deals with insurance companies or employer assistance programs.\n“We’re really focused on direct-to-consumer,” Lisa explained. “Our clients are ones that don’t want this to have anything to do with their company. In a lot of cases, they don’t want this to have anything to do with their insurance company. They could lose their jobs if [use of this type of mental health assistance] ever got out.”\nPutting this rigor around her business plan was really important to Lisa. “So many startups are just smoke and mirrors. They’re not actually making money,” she said. “So many startups are operating at such huge losses and really high valuations. I’m very committed to building WCN out in a real business sense.” She also realizes that running a service means continuously acting on end user data to optimize her profitability. “I’m going back into [my business plan] now that we have a year’s worth of real revenue and real cost data,” she explained, “to figure out where we can make some tweaks to make the largest impact without affecting the quality of service to our clients or the specialists that we partner with.”\nIn Lisa’s last role at Microsoft, she sponsored meet-ups in the Seattle and San Francisco tech scenes. As a newly-minted entrepreneur, she returned to these meet-ups to drive awareness of WCN: “You might remember me — I left Microsoft to start a company!” Lisa explained that these brief presentations prompted attendees to approach her to learn more. “That’s where a lot of our first clients came from,” she explained. “We made our first match about two months after [I left Microsoft to start the company].” To acquire more users and build up word-of-mouth potential, Lisa offered first 100 matches for free.\nLisa matched those first 100 clients manually, by learning about each client, really understanding his or her needs, and then providing a white glove handoff to a coach, therapist, or mentor. The manual validation was the quickest way to set WCN in motion, but Lisa admits that searching for specialists was (and still is) a time suck. She’s in the process of building all of her acquired matching knowledge into an algorithm with a directory of specialists to avoid the pain point moving forward. In the meantime, she’s finding ways to cut corners and make the most of precious hours — even if it’s just copy/pasting email templates.\n“Anything I was doing repeatedly…I tried to find a way to automate it,” she explained “Everything gets faster every time.”\nDriven by a mission, Lisa explained that the concept of WCN has stayed very constant since kickoff in November 2014. “We’re doing the same thing that we were doing from the beginning. I would say that our scope has gotten a little tighter,” she explained. According to Lisa, her pilot phase was an exercise in market segmentation. “Originally, when there were free matches, a lot of people were reaching out to [have introductions made]. [Those introductions] weren’t tied into the mission of helping people with real challenges. Those people were just looking for transactional things — a job, things like that,” she said.\n“Our mission is to rebrand mental health and to make trustworthy support more accessible. [WCN] is not meant to just facilitate introductions; it’s much more than that.”\nThere has been one interesting pivot that Lisa called out in her venture to date: “In the beginning, I thought that [telehealth] would be a big part of [WCN]. We were going to build the best technology for therapists to do teletherapy,” she said. However, at the urging of one of her advisors, Lisa decided to leave the means of communication open to end users, and surveyed her initial clients. “We found that over 90% of our clients prefer meeting in-person. That’s something that our competitors don’t realize yet. [Telehealth] is a cool idea, but people prefer meeting therapists and mentors in-person,” she said. This realization proved to be a key learning from a strategic and investment perspective. “What that pivot meant is that we’re not going to invest in building our own video chat technology,” said Lisa. “There’s a number of companies that do that, and they’ll take care of all of these complexities that now we don’t need to touch because we realize that it’s not actually core to the business.”\n\nLisa’s most recent #SideWalkTalk in downtown San Francisco #FightTheStigma\nWith just over a year of WCN under her belt, there have already been a few celebratory milestones for Lisa and her team. “I distinctly remember emailing my advisors at three different points: our first transaction, the first big transaction, and when we broke $1000 in revenue,” she said. “That felt like real money to me. It didn’t feel like real money to me when I was managing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a marketing budget at Microsoft.

WCN (wellconnectednow.com) is a service that personally matches professionals to mentors, coaches, and therapists. Lisa has been working on the venture for about year and a half now, and spoke candidly to us about everything from the hunt for her co-founder, to revenue milestones, to the support system who helped her take the plunge.</p>\n\n<p>Growing up in the Bay Area and attending Stanford University as an undergraduate, Lisa grew up in a hotbed of entrepreneurship: “I think like a lot of twenty- and thirty-somethings do these days, I wanted to be involved with starting a business from the ground up. I wanted to create a household brand,” she said.</p>\n\n<p>Both of Lisa’s parents worked in the technology space in San Francisco, and laid some initial groundwork for Lisa’s entrepreneurial pursuit. “I distinctly remember my parents coming home from work…frustrated…and [saying] ‘you need to be your own boss one day,’” she said.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to her parents, a former manager at Bling — a mobile payments company — really inspired Lisa to consider her own venture. This role model, who helped launch E*TRADE, spoke about the valuable experiences she gained in the entrepreneurial process: learning rapidly, and working with people who shared the same passion. “Those were all things that I wanted,” said Lisa. “[And] it was with her stamp of approval and encouragement that I went for it [with WCN]. I went all-in.”</p>\n\n<p>She does admit that “all-in” didn’t mean a full-time pursuit until a meeting with another advisor, Nate Rodland, the COO of Robinhood. <br />\n“Nate said to me, ‘There’s no f*cking way you can build a high-growth startup while working another job full-time,’” she explained.</p>\n\n<p>So, in November of 2014, Lisa left her role as a Product Marketing Manager at Microsoft to pursue WCN full-time. Without a steady salary, Lisa realized that she’d need to find support via other means. “I got a really small loan from friends and family,” she said. “You really don’t need much.”</p>\n\n<p>Lisa had already been thinking about the concept of WCN for about a year. “It was a long-time in the making. I just saw too many people who had been struggling, and I know how effective therapy can be for people,” she said. “I also know that therapists and coaches can give a lot of priceless knowledge and encouragement to people in tough times.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“I wish that there was more of a resource that people could call when their manager isn’t treating them right or they just got a bad review. I want people to have a place that they can call and get trustworthy support, wherever they are on the spectrum of dissatisfaction — whether that’s them wanting a new role or wanting to get their life together, or whether it’s getting a little darker than that.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At Microsoft, Lisa found avenues to explore these passions, coaching mentees from the Microsoft Academy of College Hires, but wanted to pursue the problem of mental health more aggressively. “It didn’t feel like enough,” she said. “70% of people struggling with depression and anxiety don’t seek treatment today. My dream is that one day, that percentage will be significantly lower, and that we can say that WCN had a direct impact in lowering that number.”</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZwyxU31-wZXHeegrSBM1GQ.jpeg\" alt=\"Lisa Abdilova’s first mental health advocacy campaign at Stanford #FightTheStigma\" /></p>\n\n<p>Lisa graduated with a degree in Psychology and Science, Technology, and Society from Stanford in 2011. She relies a great deal on her degree in building out partnerships for her venture: “As I schmooze with all of these therapists, it really helps that I can walk the walk and quote different studies and recognize the big-name therapists,” she said. However, Science, Technology, and Society is not a degree in Computer Science, which accounted for a skill gap in Lisa’s plan to run her business through an online storefront. “They always tell you to find a partner,” she said. “Any tech blog or any accelerator will encourage you to have a co-founder, especially if you’re not a developer.”</p>\n\n<p>While conducting the search for a co-founder, Lisa enrolled in a web design course through General Assembly to keep her plan in motion. And despite searching for a partner for six months, had trouble landing the perfect co-founder. Lisa recollected Nate’s assessment of her search: “At this point, we’re over six months in. The idea is running. The website’s up. You have clients in…</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"youreasolofounderwhetheryoulikeitornot\">“You’re a solo founder whether you like it or not.”</h3>\n\n<p>Although there have been some technical hurdles for Lisa, she feels confident in her role as a solo founder, particularly when thinking about company ownership. Having dedicated over a year of her life to this project, the concept of handing significant equity to someone who hasn’t been along for the journey feels backwards. “It’s not about credit, it’s about the mission,” she said. “[But] it’s not fair if one person is doing significantly more work than the other.” <br />\nWe dug into this more toward the end of our interview. When posed with the question “if you had to do it all over again, what would you change?” Lisa’s response pivoted around getting the right people invested and onboard before taking the plunge: “I would gather my team first, and leave all together. It’s hard being the first person to start a company, and it’s really hard to be the second person to decide to join.” <br />\nTruth be told, Lisa is not completely solo in her venture. She is supported by a team of six advisors with whom she has formalized contracts and advising terms. “The goal was for each advisor to supplement my skill set,” she said. Her mix of advisors ranges from former employers (“They know what you’re capable of.”), to more seasoned entrepreneurs (“They just know exactly what you need to know and how to do it.”), to technical and telehealth professionals. Lisa shared a piece of advice that someone had formerly given her when figuring out who to team up with: <br />\n“With investors and advisors, if they called you, would you want to pick up?”\nIn addition to leveraging her advisors’ knowledge, Lisa explained that she’s learning on her own at an incredibly rapid pace. “[The reality of the entrepreneurial experience is that] something comes up that you have to figure out. And you have the opportunity — because you dictate your own time — to spend the next day reading everything you possibly can about it,” she said. “And then you get to put what you learn into motion. Or you find people to help you fill in the gaps or clarify the things you don’t understand. You really do learn a ridiculous amount.” <br />\nTo supplement her background in marketing, Lisa enrolled in a program that matches entrepreneurs with Stanford business school students, who help build out business plans and advise on fundraising strategy. After three months of meetings, Lisa had a 20-page plan, complete with financial models, which she sent along to her advisors. Her advisors thought the document was comical — no one reads 20-page documents anymore — and suggested that she turn the information into a pitch deck and an executive summary (code for a well-designed flier, which Lisa later learned). A marketing intern also helped Lisa perform SWOT analysis, and identify different competitors in the space. Indirect competitors (who are getting the largest amount of funding) are establishing business-to-business telehealth offerings, setting up deals with insurance companies or employer assistance programs. <br />\n“We’re really focused on direct-to-consumer,” Lisa explained. “Our clients are ones that don’t want this to have anything to do with their company. In a lot of cases, they don’t want this to have anything to do with their insurance company. They could lose their jobs if [use of this type of mental health assistance] ever got out.”\nPutting this rigor around her business plan was really important to Lisa. “So many startups are just smoke and mirrors. They’re not actually making money,” she said. “So many startups are operating at such huge losses and really high valuations. I’m very committed to building WCN out in a real business sense.” She also realizes that running a service means continuously acting on end user data to optimize her profitability. “I’m going back into [my business plan] now that we have a year’s worth of real revenue and real cost data,” she explained, “to figure out where we can make some tweaks to make the largest impact without affecting the quality of service to our clients or the specialists that we partner with.” <br />\nIn Lisa’s last role at Microsoft, she sponsored meet-ups in the Seattle and San Francisco tech scenes. As a newly-minted entrepreneur, she returned to these meet-ups to drive awareness of WCN: “You might remember me — I left Microsoft to start a company!” Lisa explained that these brief presentations prompted attendees to approach her to learn more. “That’s where a lot of our first clients came from,” she explained. “We made our first match about two months after [I left Microsoft to start the company].” To acquire more users and build up word-of-mouth potential, Lisa offered first 100 matches for free. <br />\nLisa matched those first 100 clients manually, by learning about each client, really understanding his or her needs, and then providing a white glove handoff to a coach, therapist, or mentor. The manual validation was the quickest way to set WCN in motion, but Lisa admits that searching for specialists was (and still is) a time suck. She’s in the process of building all of her acquired matching knowledge into an algorithm with a directory of specialists to avoid the pain point moving forward. In the meantime, she’s finding ways to cut corners and make the most of precious hours — even if it’s just copy/pasting email templates. <br />\n“Anything I was doing repeatedly…I tried to find a way to automate it,” she explained “Everything gets faster every time.”\nDriven by a mission, Lisa explained that the concept of WCN has stayed very constant since kickoff in November 2014. “We’re doing the same thing that we were doing from the beginning. I would say that our scope has gotten a little tighter,” she explained. According to Lisa, her pilot phase was an exercise in market segmentation. “Originally, when there were free matches, a lot of people were reaching out to [have introductions made]. [Those introductions] weren’t tied into the mission of helping people with real challenges. Those people were just looking for transactional things — a job, things like that,” she said. <br />\n“Our mission is to rebrand mental health and to make trustworthy support more accessible. [WCN] is not meant to just facilitate introductions; it’s much more than that.”\nThere has been one interesting pivot that Lisa called out in her venture to date: “In the beginning, I thought that [telehealth] would be a big part of [WCN]. We were going to build the best technology for therapists to do teletherapy,” she said. However, at the urging of one of her advisors, Lisa decided to leave the means of communication open to end users, and surveyed her initial clients. “We found that over 90% of our clients prefer meeting in-person. That’s something that our competitors don’t realize yet. [Telehealth] is a cool idea, but people prefer meeting therapists and mentors in-person,” she said. This realization proved to be a key learning from a strategic and investment perspective. “What that pivot meant is that we’re not going to invest in building our own video chat technology,” said Lisa. “There’s a number of companies that do that, and they’ll take care of all of these complexities that now we don’t need to touch because we realize that it’s not actually core to the business.”</p>\n\n<p>Lisa’s most recent #SideWalkTalk in downtown San Francisco #FightTheStigma <br />\nWith just over a year of WCN under her belt, there have already been a few celebratory milestones for Lisa and her team. “I distinctly remember emailing my advisors at three different points: our first transaction, the first big transaction, and when we broke $1000 in revenue,” she said. “That felt like real money to me. It didn’t feel like real money to me when I was managing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a marketing budget at Microsoft. But now, I’m going to start running my paid marketing campaigns, and I can barely part with $25.” <br />\nFor Lisa, there’s no acquisition play or get-rich-quick plan when it comes to WCN. She relayed her vision for what long-term success would look like: <br />\n“WCN [would be] the go-to resource for 20- and 30-something professionals to consult throughout their careers…\nWe would have this great office in the tech hub in Seattle and San Francisco and have the best set of pre-screened therapists and coaches and mentoring programs. Expansion, continued personal involvement and control, and freedom to test her ideas are the markers of a true payoff for Lisa in this venture.” <br />\n—\nWell Connected Now personally matches professionals to mentors, coaches, and therapists — letstalkaboutanything.com</p>","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E-HMLDji8g4k3Oue6qOGRw.jpeg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Remember Me?

That much is clear. What’s not so clear is who you should ask for help: a mentor, a career coach, or maybe even a therapist?\n\nTrust me, you’re not the first person to struggle with this conundrum.\n\nAfter studying Psychology & Science, Technology & Society at Stanford, coaching Microsoft's Academy of College Hires, and marketing consumer apps around the world as a Tech Evangelist, I saw too many friends, co-workers, and mentees struggle with unsupportive managers and underwhelming roles. So much so that I founded a company with a mission to rebrand mental health, and make trustworthy support more accessible, especially for 20-30 something professionals and entrepreneurs striving for more life and career satisfaction.\n\nUnfortunately, too many struggle privately for far too long and end up feeling stuck, or worse, spiraling downward. For too many reasons, people don’t give enough credit to the incredible strength it takes to reveal your concerns and ask for more support.\n\nBlind referrals, difficulties scheduling, and incompatible matches have also made finding professional support unnecessarily harder for too many people in vulnerable times.\n\nWhile I can’t jump inside your head and make the decision for you on whether to reach out for more support, I can provide you with information that’ll help you get there on your own.\n\n\n\nWhen You Should Talk to a Mentor\n\nIf you’re just starting to feel like something might be off, a mentor could shed light on how your experience compares to other companies or roles in your industry. An outside perspective can help you learn from other people’s mistakes, experiences, and professional training. Mentors also blend professionalism and authenticity in ways that not only lead to smarter business, life, and career decisions, but also often open doors for you once you’ve risen above your challenges.\n\nFor example, when Kelly*, a consumer technology marketer wanted advice on navigating her career and getting past an unsupportive manager, she wished she could privately consult someone more experienced, senior, and familiar with her company culture. Since confidentiality can be such a grey area at work, she also preferred to talk with someone outside of her organization.\n\nKelly’s mentor met with her monthly and encouraged her to realize her full potential, despite her challenges. Armed with a trustworthy confidant fluent in reading between the lines of corporate emails and disappointing management, Kelly’s self-confidence and drive super-charged.\n\nAlthough your life can change after one 45-minute mentoring call, mentors typically volunteer to \"stop by\" monthly or so to discuss interesting challenges you’re facing and brainstorm your career steps.\n\nJust two notes: Because you’re likely going to try to impress your mentor, you’re more likely to downplay potential issues. So, be aware of that if you’re entering into this type of relationship. Also keep in mind that as awesome as a mentor can be, finding just the right person who shares your values and ambitions, plus cares enough to support you takes time.\n\n\n\nWhen You Should Talk to a Coach\n\nCoaches, on the other hand, aren’t typically tied to potential job opportunities and don’t often share professional contacts with you. They also don’t have any conflicts of interest when they’re hired individually. So, if you’re looking to consult someone weekly or every other week with fewer strings attached, this could be a better option.\n\nYou can think of these people as supportive cheerleaders. They can empower you to achieve your goals through action-oriented tips and tricks, train you on new skill sets, assist you with your job search, do negotiation role play, and even help you get through those tricky situations in the office.\n\nWhen Matt* struggled to find an engineering job after finishing a coding boot camp, for example, a resume and interview coach offered him actionable strategies on positioning his experience more confidently. Throughout this process, Matt wanted a constructive, independent appraisal from a former engineering hiring manager (not more friends or family), and that’s exactly what this coach provided.\n\nReady for the downside? This option can be expensive, since coaches often have significant industry or entrepreneurial experience and charge accordingly. They’re also not covered by health insurance.\n\n\n\nWhen You Should Talk to a Therapist\n\nWhile coaches focus more on optimistic, forward-facing business and career challenges, therapists concentrate on more of the personal core beliefs potentially holding you back.\n\nThe longer you’ve been unsatisfied, the less optimistic you might be. When negativity and frustrations are left unaddressed for too long, physical “stress-induced” pains start getting louder too, and your body’s alarms signal for things to change.\n\nAlthough therapists typically can’t offer as much business guidance or career-planning advice as coaches or mentors do, most specialize in helping you when you’re:\n\nFeeling stressed and overwhelmed\nHaving trouble sleeping, socializing, relaxing, or focusing\nNoticing changes in your appetite, hygiene, or lifestyle\nExperiencing back, neck, or shoulder pain as well as muscle tension\nStruggling with unusually low self-confidence\nHaving trouble connecting with other people\nSpiraling into potential signs of depression or anxiety\nWhen Michael*, a software engineer, struggled with some of these early signs of depression, he knew it was time to speak to someone who specialized in the topic. He’d struggled with low energy, self-defeating thoughts, insomnia, and high irritability for months already. He was sick of it. This wasn’t him. He was ready for a change.\n\nAfter just a couple sessions, Michael shared that the experience made him realize that he wasn’t clinically depressed, but rather just needed to quit his job. His company’s hiring bar had significantly dropped, and he was left to pick up the team’s slack. Without many teammates left to consult or learn from, he found himself demotivated and increasingly more resistant to taking on more work.\n\nAfter seeing a therapist, he realized his frustrations centered around needing to break free. Michael explained, “I realized there’s nothing actually wrong with me...They can keep asking me to stay, but I am going to travel the world like I’ve always wanted.”\n\nAs far as costs go, therapists really range depending on where you’re located and what your insurance deductible is. However, many offer sliding scale rates, which means they are open to negotiating their bill rate, especially if you’re going out of network or truly can’t afford it.\n\n\n\nFight the Stigma\n\nMy dream is that one day, people will feel more comfortable asking for help when they need it—because it actually takes great strength and vulnerability to realize you can't get where you want to go in your life or career on your own.\n\nAsk any successful person how he or she got there, and you’ll almost always hear about someone who opened a door, offered advice, or gave a necessary confidence boost at a critical time.\n\nSo, now that you’re armed with all this info, give a mentor, coach, or therapist a try.\n\n\n\n*Please note that some names and other identifying details have been altered to protect the confidentiality of our clients.\n\n*Originally posted on The Daily Muse - https://www.themuse.com/advice/mentors-career-coaches-and-therapists-which-ones-best-to-get-you-out-of-your-rut","html":"<p>So, you’re having a problem navigating a tricky situation at the office and you know you need help figuring it out.

His company’s hiring bar had significantly dropped, and he was left to pick up the team’s slack. Without many teammates left to consult or learn from, he found himself demotivated and increasingly more resistant to taking on more work.</p>\n\n<p>After seeing a therapist, he realized his frustrations centered around needing to break free. Michael explained, “I realized there’s nothing actually wrong with me...They can keep asking me to stay, but I am going to travel the world like I’ve always wanted.”</p>\n\n<p>As far as costs go, therapists really range depending on where you’re located and what your insurance deductible is.

These books have helped me grow into someone that my family, close friends, and my younger self can be proud of, and I hope they can help you in a similar way.\n\n1. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen Covey\nIn this landmark book, Stephen Covey introduces the concept of the Abundance Mindset as opposed to the Scarcity Mindset. He very convincingly explains that success in business and in life is not achieved through an “I win, they lose” mentality. True prosperity comes in delivering value to others at the highest possible level and by doing so, you win. In my opinion, this argument dispels the myth that the wealthy get where they are through theft, greed, and manipulation. For the most part, they get there by delivering unmatched quality of products or services, and having a “win/win” mentality. Those who are successful celebrate the achievements and prosperity of others, as opposed to being envious or jealous. Another concept of the book that particularly resonated with me is the time management quadrant. This really clarified my own life for me and made me question how much of my time I was spending in time-wasting, entertainment focused activities, as opposed to activities that will enrich my life and bring me closer to the type of life that I desired.\n\n2. Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill\nWhen Napoleon Hill was a young journalist he met Andrew Carnegie, who took an interest in him and gave him the following idea for a project: to create THE philosophy for success and achievement. This book would consume the next 25 years of Hill’s life as he interviewed and shadowed some of the world’s most successful men, including Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, and Charles Schwab, just to name a few. The book introduced several timeless principles that are still utilized by many people today. \n\nOne of the most important is bringing together a mastermind group of people who are much smarter and have certain expertise you don’t have to work towards achieving your personal and shared goals. This book also concentrates on developing a positive mindset. Hill shows how you can achieve what you want in life through strong, bulletproof desire, actively filtering out negative thoughts, and working persistently towards your goals.\n\n3. The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment - Eckhart Tolle\nThis powerful book can change your life after the first read. Tolle explains that the past and the future are illusions created by the ego, and could be the source for all the pain and suffering in our lives. You may spend the majority of your time thinking about what has happened to you in the past (mostly bad stuff), or what might happen to you in the future (again, mostly bad stuff).  Then your brain will keep creating explanations, judgments, and plans. You miss out on the realities of the present moment when you’re stuck in the past and future like that though. You may miss out on your own life, because you continue sleepwalking in this dream state of mostly self-deprecating negative thoughts. When you’re spending your day off with your family, you’re thinking about what’s going to go wrong at work next week, and when you’re at work, you’re dreaming about being able to spend a day off with your family -- you never have peace. What Tolle teaches is certainly not new. Buddhism has taught the concept of present moment awareness through meditation for thousands of years, but what Tolle has done has taken this concept and thrown it in your face persuasively and clearly enough so that you actually understand “The Power of Now” enough to practice it.\n\n\n4. Rich Dad Poor Dad\n\nAlthough my Russian Jewish immigrant parents ingrained many of the principles in this book for me already, this book wrote out and so validated what I suspected most of my life. Save more money than you spend. Invest it in assets that will grow in value, and generate income for you. Become the investor/owner, not the employee. Being an employee could just be a temporary situation until you save and invest enough money to buy the company. I saw plenty of my relatives who came to this country with no money in their pocket, well into their 30’s and 40’s, and became wealthy in as little as 5 to 10 years without even speaking English, much less having a college degree. They persistently hustled day in and day out, lived well below their means, and invested as often and as much as they could. This book has still benefited me greatly as it could for anyone else who reads it. Especially if you didn’t do so well in high school or followed a nontraditional path around college, your life is not over, you can still become very wealthy. In fact, in certain respects, you have an advantage over many of those who did go to college. I’m not going to spoil the book for you, so you have to read it and discover the reasons for yourself. \n\n5.Steve Jobs - Walter Isaacson\nThere’s one of two takeaways you’ll get from reading this book. #1 Steve Jobs was very lucky. He was born in the right place, at the right time. #2 Steve Jobs was one of the hardest working people the world has ever known. He had laser focused vision and discipline to accomplish his objectives. He didn’t deviate one bit from what he knew was right. It was his strong, yet charming personality and unwavering sense of confidence that changed the world. No, this book is not technically a self improvement book; however, it does teach us an important lesson about an average Joe, who was plagued with disadvantages early in his life, lived as a hippy, dropped acid, and dropped out of college, only to become, arguably, one of the most important figures in the history of human progress. If you wish to become great, you must study greatness, and there isn’t much better you can get than the man who created iTunes and the iPhone. Walter Isaacson is also a phenomenal writer and wrote outstanding biographies about Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin as well.\n\n6. Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life - Maxwell Maltz\nAfter several decades as a plastic surgeon, Maxwell Maltz discovered that what many of his patients really needed wasn’t a plastic surgery, but a mental makeover. He observed patients that came to his office with horrific scars, who were shy, timid, anxiety prone worriers, and after he successfully removed their scars, it was almost like they became a confident adventurer with a newly-found enthusiasm for life. While others that he operated on, no matter how “normal” they looked, kept thinking something was wrong with them and preventing them from truly being happy. It was then that he sought to research the psychology involved with the way people see themselves, and how it affects their lives. One of the most important takeaways of this book is the power of visualization. How do you see yourself in your mind’s eye? Maltz theorized that the way you visualize yourself in your mind, is the way you will inevitably become. You must make it a constant habit to picture yourself as already being the person that you want to be. If you have a job interview coming up, actively imagine yourself impressing the interviewer with your confidence and charisma. Picture yourself answering all their questions with ease, in a state of relaxation. You see, the physical body does not know the difference between reality and something vividly imagined. So you can literally create your own reality through the use of these powerful visualization techniques.\n\n7. Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand\nNow let’s ignore that this book has a very strong political message throughout the text. Let’s also try to forget that it’s more than 1,200 pages in length. This book’s real power is in changing the way you understand the moral obligation you have in becoming the best possible person you can. One thing that this book teaches that even the most ardent political opponent of Randian philosophy must agree with is that human progress does not come about automatically. Our advancements in society have come through a culmination of individual effort. After all, society is simply just a term used to describe a collection of individuals. What this book will teach you is that you as an individual have the power to change the lives of countless people in a positive way. Through your own, seemingly selfish, pursuit of being the best you can possibly be, you become more valuable to others. You create better products and services that others need. And you, as an individual, are a vital piece in the advancement of human civilization. If Steve Jobs were not born, computers and phones would not be the same as we know them today. This is true of many of the world’s greatest innovations that have helped to eliminate poverty and suffering on a major scale. Remember, that you as an individual have the power to change the world, but there’s no way you can do that if you don’t understand just how important you really are, and you don’t work your butt off every single day to realize your potential.\n\n---\n\n“If you’re not growing, then you’re dying” warns a popular quote. \n\nProgress is the theme of human evolution. Life is about transformation. Whether we like it or not, today is different from yesterday, and tomorrow will be different from today. Nothing is static and the world continues to change. \n\nAre you reacting to these changes with fear, worry, anxiety, anger, self-doubt, or envy? \n\nHow can you counteract those natural tendencies with more confidence and enthusiasm?\n\nTry reading or listening[audible links] to one of these books for more self-improvement tips.”\n","html":"<p>The fundamental misunderstanding people seem to have about “self-help” is that something needs to be wrong with you if you’re searching for how to help yourself.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, successful and well-established people often devote themselves to the pursuit of self-improvement in most aspects of their life, including health, fitness, career advancement, and even spiritual enlightenment.</p>\n\n<p>The most successful people (and this doesn’t just mean economically successful) constantly strive to become better versions of themselves.

I've also heard countless stories from professionals and therapists all over the world about the transformative powers of their supporters.\n\nMaybe you're not so sure about therapy yet though, and that's okay. If the stigma wasn't so strong, maybe more of these stories could reach you too. Imagine your friends posting \"Therapy worked for me!\" on your Facebook feed. \n\nTill then, hear Jay Reid, data scientist & psychotherapist intern, explain the benefits of therapy, the importance of the right match, and how he knows therapy works. \n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTlcMss2pFM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n**LA:** \"Hey Well Connected Now, it's me, Lisa Abdilova, here with San Francisco therapist-in-training, Jay Reid, who I'm excited to introduce you to. I'll ask Jay some questions to give you an inside look into how therapy actually works. It's going to be great. Now I want to give you the chance to introduce yourself to our community of professionals all over the world.\n\n**JR:** Great, thanks Lisa. My name's Jay Reid, and I'm a practicing psychotherapist intern in downtown San Francisco. I've been doing that for the past 3 years, and I'm really excited to be here today.\n\n**LA:** Awesome. So, I know that you come from a data science background, and so, of course when it comes to data science, having quantitative, objective data that you can look at is important. Well, I'm wondering if you can tell us based on that experience--\n\n##**How do you know therapy works?**\n\n**JR:**  Having the analytics mindset does help with this question, and I know it on three different levels. \n\n**The first one is my own experience.** I've been in my own psychotherapy, or been a client, and found it to be immensely helpful in me achieving the goals in my life that I want to, that are right for me, and correspond to my deepest values - what I want in my life. \n\n**The second one would be the changes I see take in effect in my own clients in my own clinical work**-- where by building a very trustworthy, attuned relationship with someone, I've seen them make use of that to go into their own lives and make decisions where they're showing a higher valuation for themselves, their feelings, their experience, then maybe they've done in the past, or maybe doing that with their partner, becoming more capable of understanding that partner's experience and connecting to it and then enjoying a much richer and deeper relationship. \n\n**The third part that tells me therapy works is nothing I've discovered, but rather 60 years of psychotherapy process and outcome research.** What research shows is that people who receive psychotherapy are better off symptom-wise than 80% of those who do not go, or who go untreated, or don't receive psychotherapy. You know it's big because these findings are controlled studies where someone is getting psychotherapy, and someone who looks very similar to that, who's randomly assigned, is put on a waiting list. \n\nDuring that time, the person who receives psychotherapy improves remarkably better than the person on the waitlist. So it's not just sort of \"time heals all wounds\" - it's that something effective is happening in therapy. \n\n**LA:** Yes! \n\n##What other factors do you think are important in finding just the right therapist for someone?\n\n\n**JR:** Well, I think it's about fit -- how understood [you feel], and part of the process of feeling understood, I tend to think, means not feeling judged or labeled, or in any way undermined or anything like that, but really feeling aligned with by the therapist. Research supports this too. \n\nWhat research finds is it's not necessarily the brand of therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral-therapy (CBT) or psychoanalytic analysis, or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), that have different rates of improvement, or one's more effective than the other. \n\n**It's actually the quality of the alliance between the therapist and the client that is one of the most predictive factors of symptom improvement.** \n\nThat corresponds to common sense too. Lots of people who go to therapy may, in the first session, feel like I just can't connect with this person, and unfortunately, they may leave. \n\nSo, I think a service like Well Connected Now is actually doing a great thing, because you're saying hey, we're not going to leave you in the lurch if you don't feel that alliance. We're going to help you and circle the wagons so you do find that person. And research supports that is going to lead to better outcomes for your customers, which is why we're all in this anyway, right. \n\n**LA:** Exactly, Yes! It's so unfortunate how many people have taken the daring and courageous step to go into a therapist's office for the first time, and then ended up walking out feeling worse then they came in. \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of those people have written off therapy altogether, and what we want to show, is that hey, maybe that specialist that you talked to didn't practice the most evidence-backed approach to what you were struggling with. Maybe they didn't have that background, because they didn't specialize in what you're struggling with. \n\n##**Jay, tell us, for example, if a client was struggling with addiction or  body image issues, how different would their therapist be from someone who'd be coming in with social anxiety?**\n\n\n**JR:** Well, that's a good question. Things like addiction and eating disorders can occupy their own sort of niche. In the sense that, and I've worked in addiction, and in those cases, I liken it to doing psychotherapy, but with the awareness that if the addiction really takes hold with the client, it's a possibility that they're going to take the car and drive it 30 mph into a brick wall... It could be that life threatening. \n\nSo, you've got this specter of a potentially bad outcome happening, and you're also trying to provide what good therapy is: support, attunement, empathic understanding. So, it's markedly different in that way because you never want to discount the severity of the addiction, and you know within addiction and body image disorders, it's a body and mind \"disorder\" that affects their thinking. So, being watchful of that addictive or binge/purging way of thinking and processing reality and countering it is different. There's a bit more urgency to that in the work, then say if someone wasn't in the throes of of an addiction or an eating disorder where their health was potentially being compromised. So, I think that it's extremely important [to find the right therapist], particularly in those areas. In other disorders like social anxiety, which I think, is another good example, because you may read a lot that CBT is the only treatment for social anxiety - you'd read that maybe on an internet website, but the research also suggests otherwise. \n\nPsychodynamic therapy achieves similar outcomes at termination, and in a few studies, better outcomes at 6 months follow-up, which supports this other finding that it's not necessarily the type of therapy, it's the quality of the connection. \n\n**LA:** Yea, it's this balance of it being so important that the match is compatible, and it's also important that the therapist has some frame of reference to the distorted thinking patterns behind those challenges. \n\n**JR:** Yea, another point too about finding fit and the therapists' contribution to that is them feeling effective in treating this type of problem. And if it happens to be addiction, if you're not trained in that and experienced in it, it's going to be hard to feel effective and have a sense of confidence in that.\n\nAnd that likely will be felt or at least noticed by the client, and that could pull down the alliance and make it harder. I think they all work together hand in hand to create a right fit or alliance. \n\n**LA:** Wow, so it's their lack of familiarity and potential expertise in that area that could effect their confidence, which could get in the way of the actual connection. \n\n**JR:** Right. So that is good because all the training we go through- it's for a reason--which is cool that it actually plays into the outcome in that way - potentially a little indirectly via the alliance, but still importantly, nonetheless. \n\n**LA:** Great, thank you. \n\n##For the people who haven't been to a therapy session before, could you tell us more about what types of conversations come up?\n\nJR: Sure. I should first say that people don't usually lie down, and a lot of us don't have beards or wear glasses or elbow patches. \n\nSo, you're sitting across from one another, and what I - I mean some therapists are different - but what I tend to do is say this is your time, and what I'd like you to do is just talk about what's on your mind. \n\nIn the course of doing that, what I will be trying to do is follow you and reflect that back to you, and that's not just verbally -- I really try to get myself into the experience you're having. Even non-verbal things like facial expressions can all be part of that. This is all towards the goal of you feeling comfortable in going even deeper into your experience and what you're feeling and exploring it.\n\n***You'll know that you're not going to get labeled or questioned or judged. You're being sought to be understood.***\n\nOnce that really gets under your skin, then you really believe it and feel that that's what's happening here, then you begin to make really good use of the time.\n\nYou go and feel things, become aware of things that just weren't necessarily there before, or see the same thing but from a different vantage point that generally serves your interest. \n\nSo, I think it's a good thing and hopefully most people will feel better after a therapy session when practiced in this way then not. I think feeling better is a marker of good things, and you shouldn't necessarily have to feel bad or not understood. \n\n**LA:** It's also amazing to have someone that could listen to all the skeletons you may be hiding in your closet, and be able to tell you that hey, they like you anyway. They still want to see you next week and that you still have incredible strengths that balance out the qualities you may be beating yourself up for, or that may be limiting you. \n\nSo many challenges are treatable, and not enough people know what therapy can do for them, or what therapists can do for them, which brings me to my next question -- \n\n##Based on your experience in the corporate and data science world, what do you think most people don't know about what therapists are actually like?\n\n**JR:** Well, I've found that in the corporate cultures I've been exposed to, everything is about solving the business problem at hand, and you build relationships with people and they're close, but depending on the environment you're in, there's going to be certain limits about how much you can disclose about how you're feeling that day or something that's on your mind, or things like that. \n\nIf you're in an environment where that's just not part of the interpersonal currency, like it's not normal, in a sense, to say yea, I'm having a terrible day. I had a bad argument with my partner last night or something to that effect, so that you can get that off your chest, feel a little bit better, feel a little connected to somebody else, and then move on to the problem at hand--then it can create a kind of thing where people are wrestling with a lot of stuff, but kind of within the silo of their own mind, and potentially not with the awareness that there's a better way to do it. \n\nYou can go talk to somebody and that feeling like you're walking with somebody in this, rather than having to deal with it all within yourself is just so empowering for the person, for people, but I don't think that that is a widely known or felt sentiment. I think it's more like just- handle-it-all-myself.

Thank you so much for taking the time and thank you all for listening. \n\nTake care of yourselves.","html":"<p><strong>It's time to let go of this outdated, stigmatized perception of therapy.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I am convinced therapy works, because I've read the outcomes research and studied the healing effects of therapeutic alliances. I've also heard countless stories from professionals and therapists all over the world about the transformative powers of their supporters.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you're not so sure about therapy yet though, and that's okay. If the stigma wasn't so strong, maybe more of these stories could reach you too. Imagine your friends posting \"Therapy worked for me!\" on your Facebook feed. </p>\n\n<p>Till then, hear Jay Reid, data scientist &amp; psychotherapist intern, explain the benefits of therapy, the importance of the right match, and how he knows therapy works.  </p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTlcMss2pFM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> \"Hey Well Connected Now, it's me, Lisa Abdilova, here with San Francisco therapist-in-training, Jay Reid, who I'm excited to introduce you to. I'll ask Jay some questions to give you an inside look into how therapy actually works. It's going to be great. Now I want to give you the chance to introduce yourself to our community of professionals all over the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Great, thanks Lisa. My name's Jay Reid, and I'm a practicing psychotherapist intern in downtown San Francisco. I've been doing that for the past 3 years, and I'm really excited to be here today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> Awesome. So, I know that you come from a data science background, and so, of course when it comes to data science, having quantitative, objective data that you can look at is important. Well, I'm wondering if you can tell us based on that experience--</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"howdoyouknowtherapyworks\"><strong>How do you know therapy works?</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>JR:</strong>  Having the analytics mindset does help with this question, and I know it on three different levels. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The first one is my own experience.</strong> I've been in my own psychotherapy, or been a client, and found it to be immensely helpful in me achieving the goals in my life that I want to, that are right for me, and correspond to my deepest values - what I want in my life. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The second one would be the changes I see take in effect in my own clients in my own clinical work</strong>-- where by building a very trustworthy, attuned relationship with someone, I've seen them make use of that to go into their own lives and make decisions where they're showing a higher valuation for themselves, their feelings, their experience, then maybe they've done in the past, or maybe doing that with their partner, becoming more capable of understanding that partner's experience and connecting to it and then enjoying a much richer and deeper relationship. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The third part that tells me therapy works is nothing I've discovered, but rather 60 years of psychotherapy process and outcome research.</strong> What research shows is that people who receive psychotherapy are better off symptom-wise than 80% of those who do not go, or who go untreated, or don't receive psychotherapy. You know it's big because these findings are controlled studies where someone is getting psychotherapy, and someone who looks very similar to that, who's randomly assigned, is put on a waiting list. </p>\n\n<p>During that time, the person who receives psychotherapy improves remarkably better than the person on the waitlist. So it's not just sort of \"time heals all wounds\" - it's that something effective is happening in therapy. </p>\n\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> Yes! </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whatotherfactorsdoyouthinkareimportantinfindingjusttherighttherapistforsomeone\">What other factors do you think are important in finding just the right therapist for someone?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Well, I think it's about fit -- how understood [you feel], and part of the process of feeling understood, I tend to think, means not feeling judged or labeled, or in any way undermined or anything like that, but really feeling aligned with by the therapist. Research supports this too. </p>\n\n<p>What research finds is it's not necessarily the brand of therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral-therapy (CBT) or psychoanalytic analysis, or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), that have different rates of improvement, or one's more effective than the other. </p>\n\n<p><strong>It's actually the quality of the alliance between the therapist and the client that is one of the most predictive factors of symptom improvement.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>That corresponds to common sense too. Lots of people who go to therapy may, in the first session, feel like I just can't connect with this person, and unfortunately, they may leave. </p>\n\n<p>So, I think a service like Well Connected Now is actually doing a great thing, because you're saying hey, we're not going to leave you in the lurch if you don't feel that alliance. We're going to help you and circle the wagons so you do find that person. And research supports that is going to lead to better outcomes for your customers, which is why we're all in this anyway, right. </p>\n\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> Exactly, Yes! It's so unfortunate how many people have taken the daring and courageous step to go into a therapist's office for the first time, and then ended up walking out feeling worse then they came in. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, a lot of those people have written off therapy altogether, and what we want to show, is that hey, maybe that specialist that you talked to didn't practice the most evidence-backed approach to what you were struggling with. Maybe they didn't have that background, because they didn't specialize in what you're struggling with. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"jaytellusforexampleifaclientwasstrugglingwithaddictionorbodyimageissueshowdifferentwouldtheirtherapistbefromsomeonewhodbecominginwithsocialanxiety\"><strong>Jay, tell us, for example, if a client was struggling with addiction or  body image issues, how different would their therapist be from someone who'd be coming in with social anxiety?</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Well, that's a good question. Things like addiction and eating disorders can occupy their own sort of niche. In the sense that, and I've worked in addiction, and in those cases, I liken it to doing psychotherapy, but with the awareness that if the addiction really takes hold with the client, it's a possibility that they're going to take the car and drive it 30 mph into a brick wall... It could be that life threatening. </p>\n\n<p>So, you've got this specter of a potentially bad outcome happening, and you're also trying to provide what good therapy is: support, attunement, empathic understanding. So, it's markedly different in that way because you never want to discount the severity of the addiction, and you know within addiction and body image disorders, it's a body and mind \"disorder\" that affects their thinking. So, being watchful of that addictive or binge/purging way of thinking and processing reality and countering it is different. There's a bit more urgency to that in the work, then say if someone wasn't in the throes of of an addiction or an eating disorder where their health was potentially being compromised. So, I think that it's extremely important [to find the right therapist], particularly in those areas. In other disorders like social anxiety, which I think, is another good example, because you may read a lot that CBT is the only treatment for social anxiety - you'd read that maybe on an internet website, but the research also suggests otherwise. </p>\n\n<p>Psychodynamic therapy achieves similar outcomes at termination, and in a few studies, better outcomes at 6 months follow-up, which supports this other finding that it's not necessarily the type of therapy, it's the quality of the connection. </p>\n\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> Yea, it's this balance of it being so important that the match is compatible, and it's also important that the therapist has some frame of reference to the distorted thinking patterns behind those challenges. </p>\n\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yea, another point too about finding fit and the therapists' contribution to that is them feeling effective in treating this type of problem. And if it happens to be addiction, if you're not trained in that and experienced in it, it's going to be hard to feel effective and have a sense of confidence in that.</p>\n\n<p>And that likely will be felt or at least noticed by the client, and that could pull down the alliance and make it harder. I think they all work together hand in hand to create a right fit or alliance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> Wow, so it's their lack of familiarity and potential expertise in that area that could effect their confidence, which could get in the way of the actual connection. </p>\n\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Right. So that is good because all the training we go through- it's for a reason--which is cool that it actually plays into the outcome in that way - potentially a little indirectly via the alliance, but still importantly, nonetheless. </p>\n\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> Great, thank you. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"forthepeoplewhohaventbeentoatherapysessionbeforecouldyoutellusmoreaboutwhattypesofconversationscomeup\">For the people who haven't been to a therapy session before, could you tell us more about what types of conversations come up?</h2>\n\n<p>JR: Sure. I should first say that people don't usually lie down, and a lot of us don't have beards or wear glasses or elbow patches. </p>\n\n<p>So, you're sitting across from one another, and what I - I mean some therapists are different - but what I tend to do is say this is your time, and what I'd like you to do is just talk about what's on your mind. </p>\n\n<p>In the course of doing that, what I will be trying to do is follow you and reflect that back to you, and that's not just verbally -- I really try to get myself into the experience you're having. Even non-verbal things like facial expressions can all be part of that. This is all towards the goal of you feeling comfortable in going even deeper into your experience and what you're feeling and exploring it.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>You'll know that you're not going to get labeled or questioned or judged. You're being sought to be understood.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Once that really gets under your skin, then you really believe it and feel that that's what's happening here, then you begin to make really good use of the time.</p>\n\n<p>You go and feel things, become aware of things that just weren't necessarily there before, or see the same thing but from a different vantage point that generally serves your interest. </p>\n\n<p>So, I think it's a good thing and hopefully most people will feel better after a therapy session when practiced in this way then not. I think feeling better is a marker of good things, and you shouldn't necessarily have to feel bad or not understood. </p>\n\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> It's also amazing to have someone that could listen to all the skeletons you may be hiding in your closet, and be able to tell you that hey, they like you anyway. They still want to see you next week and that you still have incredible strengths that balance out the qualities you may be beating yourself up for, or that may be limiting you. </p>\n\n<p>So many challenges are treatable, and not enough people know what therapy can do for them, or what therapists can do for them, which brings me to my next question -- </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"basedonyourexperienceinthecorporateanddatascienceworldwhatdoyouthinkmostpeopledontknowaboutwhattherapistsareactuallylike\">Based on your experience in the corporate and data science world, what do you think most people don't know about what therapists are actually like?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Well, I've found that in the corporate cultures I've been exposed to, everything is about solving the business problem at hand, and you build relationships with people and they're close, but depending on the environment you're in, there's going to be certain limits about how much you can disclose about how you're feeling that day or something that's on your mind, or things like that. </p>\n\n<p>If you're in an environment where that's just not part of the interpersonal currency, like it's not normal, in a sense, to say yea, I'm having a terrible day. I had a bad argument with my partner last night or something to that effect, so that you can get that off your chest, feel a little bit better, feel a little connected to somebody else, and then move on to the problem at hand--then it can create a kind of thing where people are wrestling with a lot of stuff, but kind of within the silo of their own mind, and potentially not with the awareness that there's a better way to do it. </p>\n\n<p>You can go talk to somebody and that feeling like you're walking with somebody in this, rather than having to deal with it all within yourself is just so empowering for the person, for people, but I don't think that that is a widely known or felt sentiment. I think it's more like just- handle-it-all-myself. It's certainly not welcome in a lot of corporate cultures, so I'm just going to do my own thing.. that's how I'm going to do it. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, a lot of times then, things may need to come to a head, before it's time to reach out. So, yea, it'd be great if therapy were less stigmatized and more openly accepted and recognized for the benefits that it can hold. </p>\n\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> Yea, and that more people could reach out sooner.

Are you generous, caring, funny, and loyal? Remember that. What do you deserve in return? You don't have to settle for less.\n\nPerhaps it’s because I’m a woman, but I’ve also felt this internal pressure from a young age to always give. I have more compassion for my own “no” now, especially when I am asked for something that I just don’t want to give. As a therapist, I’ve had to learn that I can only give what I have, and that has to come from a place of giving to myself first. I also consciously give myself permission to receive others' love. \n\n>You might not expect feeling loved to be difficult, but to accept someone's love means believing you are worthy of it. That's not always easy for people.\n\nIf your self-esteem may be shaky, then you might find yourself doubting others' love, no matter what they say or who they are. This is precisely why loving yourself comes first.\n\n####2: Focus. Set aside distractions.\n\nCreate space for yourself that is conducive to the outcome you want to create. \n\nWhen beginning a new relationship or prioritizing an existing relationship, this might look like discontinuing phone calls to your ex, or that hottie you kinda have a “thing” with, but who never really seems to show up when you need them to (and always seems to show up when you don’t really want them to.) \n\nIt could also look like cutting back on work, especially if your life feels too cluttered with projects.\n\n####3: Figure out what you're looking for.\nVisualize and talk about what you want. Sharpen that vision so you can develop clarity. I’m not saying write a list of things you want in a partner (sexy, tall, blonde, funny, good job, cute dimple, etc.) \n\nI’m talking about what YOU want for yourself – a committed relationship? Casual sex? A slew of dates every week?  You can start to visualize the qualities you want in your relationship as well, and share these with your partner to see where you both align. \n\nAs you visualize and get clear about what you want, take that fantasy monologue out of your head and bring it in to either writing or dialogue to further develop your vision. Talk to a friend, coach, therapist, or just write it down in a journal or a piece of paper.\n\n####4: Learn how to talk about what you want. \n\n>You have the right to your own preferences. If you share what you want with others, you could actually get what you want more often. \n\nEasier said then done, but practice makes perfect.   Try talking about what you want more often overall. Then, you can do so more freely in your new relationships. \n\nAs a bonus, learn to engage others on what they really want too. Develop your ability to listen to others. You can foster real intimacy by discussing and supporting each other's big dreams and relationship ideals. \n\nPractice this skill on dates. Really listen to the other person, and you will get to know a lot about who they are, what they want, and if they are a good partner for you given what YOU want.\n\n####5: Cultivate an attitude of openness, experimentation, and learning. \n\nTry approaching that person you like, or initiating the kiss, even when you're nervous.  Try sending some winky face texts or read up on flirting. See how it goes. If it worked, great. If it didn’t, what can you learn about who you approach, how you approach them, or about things like persistence and tenacity?\n\nIf something's not working, remember you can always try something else. That goes for how you're expressing yourself as well. For example, maybe screaming your feelings is a sign this convo started too late.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/09/coffee-shop-worry-smaller-1.jpeg)\n\n####6: Be discerning.\n\nGo back to steps one and two. When you’re talking to someone you like, think about what you want and what you visualized. Is this person someone who fits what you're looking for? If yes, advance to step 3, and find out what this person is looking for too. \n\n>Believe them before you try to change them. \n\nAre they looking for casual sex while you’re looking for a committed relationship?  If so, thumbs up to them and thumbs up to you for noticing sooner than later. Now, you can move on to the next one, and save yourself some heartache.\n\n####7. Be persistent.\nWhat do you do to get a job? Pursue all leads. Look in every corner and direction. Apply every day to jobs, and follow up.  \n\nThis translates in dating as: don’t be a flake.  If you are only showing up when you feel like it, you will meet a lot of singles who only show up when they feel like it too. If you show up fully, you will begin to sort out the flakes from the non-flakes, and meet more people ready to share their life wholeheartedly with someone else. \n\nIn relationships, this translates as: When things get hard, explore what's hard about them and address them with your partner. \n\n####8: Acknowledge your fears, but don’t be guided by them.\n\nBe honest with yourself. You’re afraid of something? Congratulations – you’re a vulnerable and awesome human being. We are all scared of something, especially when it comes to relationships. \n\n>Don’t ignore your fears or they may lead you. People don't realize how often they may be revealing their insecurities. Instead, acknowledge your fear, and from there, make a clear choice about how willing you are to face it. \n\nLet’s say you’re afraid of rejection. You’re at a bar and you see a guy/girl you’re into. Acknowledge your fear and ask yourself what you really want (see steps 2-4). Give yourself a pep-talk. Say “I know you’re scared. I know you can try this differently though, and aim for what you really want out of this situation.” If nothing else, you will at least give yourself the confidence to face your fears.   \n\nOr let’s say the situation is commitment. You notice that whenever a relationship gets to a certain point, you call it quits or get bored. Next time it happens, notice that it’s happening. Say to yourself “I know I'm scared. How can I do this differently this time though?” Make room for something different to happen by making new choices for yourself.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-29-at-12.08.24-PM-1.png)\n\n####9: Learn the 5 Love Languages.\n\nLastly, this book on \"[The Five Languages of Love: The Secret to Love that Lasts\" by Gary Chapman](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X) could completely change the way you perceive relationships. Even after I learned the names of these five languages, I realized people had been showing me love all along, but in ways I had been missing, because their natural love languages were different from mine.\n\n**What are your primary love languages?**\n\n1. Words of Affirmation\n2. Acts of Service \n3. Gifts\n4. Quality Time\n5. Physical Touch\n\nFor example, I instantly realized the differences between my partner's primary love languages (Acts of Service, Gifts), and mine (Quality Time, Words of Affirmation). Now I understood why we kept missing each other, like ships in the night.  I also got to see the places where we were similar (Physical Affection). \n\nNow, when my partner cleans the kitchen or offers to pick something up for me, I realize that it's his \"Acts of Service\" way of saying \"I love you\". I also understand now why he's so appreciative of even the smallest knickknack I bring him (\"Gifts\").\n\nI've also learned to have more compassion and less judgment when someone seems to be withholding something.  I look instead for the other ways in which they may be giving, and become more aware of whether I'm expressing my love for them in the ways they can most appreciate them.\n\n\n#####In summary, here's Lauren Korshak's 9 tips for navigating new relationships:\n\n1.

If you share what you want with others, you could actually get what you want more often. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Easier said then done, but practice makes perfect.   Try talking about what you want more often overall. Then, you can do so more freely in your new relationships. </p>\n\n<p>As a bonus, learn to engage others on what they really want too. Develop your ability to listen to others. You can foster real intimacy by discussing and supporting each other's big dreams and relationship ideals. </p>\n\n<p>Practice this skill on dates. Really listen to the other person, and you will get to know a lot about who they are, what they want, and if they are a good partner for you given what YOU want.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"5cultivateanattitudeofopennessexperimentationandlearning\">5: Cultivate an attitude of openness, experimentation, and learning.</h4>\n\n<p>Try approaching that person you like, or initiating the kiss, even when you're nervous.  Try sending some winky face texts or read up on flirting. See how it goes. If it worked, great. If it didn’t, what can you learn about who you approach, how you approach them, or about things like persistence and tenacity?</p>\n\n<p>If something's not working, remember you can always try something else. That goes for how you're expressing yourself as well. For example, maybe screaming your feelings is a sign this convo started too late.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/09/coffee-shop-worry-smaller-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"6bediscerning\">6: Be discerning.</h4>\n\n<p>Go back to steps one and two. When you’re talking to someone you like, think about what you want and what you visualized. Is this person someone who fits what you're looking for? If yes, advance to step 3, and find out what this person is looking for too. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Believe them before you try to change them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are they looking for casual sex while you’re looking for a committed relationship?  If so, thumbs up to them and thumbs up to you for noticing sooner than later. Now, you can move on to the next one, and save yourself some heartache.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"7bepersistent\">7. Be persistent.</h4>\n\n<p>What do you do to get a job? Pursue all leads. Look in every corner and direction. Apply every day to jobs, and follow up.  </p>\n\n<p>This translates in dating as: don’t be a flake.  If you are only showing up when you feel like it, you will meet a lot of singles who only show up when they feel like it too. If you show up fully, you will begin to sort out the flakes from the non-flakes, and meet more people ready to share their life wholeheartedly with someone else. </p>\n\n<p>In relationships, this translates as: When things get hard, explore what's hard about them and address them with your partner. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"8acknowledgeyourfearsbutdontbeguidedbythem\">8: Acknowledge your fears, but don’t be guided by them.</h4>\n\n<p>Be honest with yourself. You’re afraid of something? Congratulations – you’re a vulnerable and awesome human being. We are all scared of something, especially when it comes to relationships. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don’t ignore your fears or they may lead you. People don't realize how often they may be revealing their insecurities. Instead, acknowledge your fear, and from there, make a clear choice about how willing you are to face it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let’s say you’re afraid of rejection. You’re at a bar and you see a guy/girl you’re into. Acknowledge your fear and ask yourself what you really want (see steps 2-4). Give yourself a pep-talk. Say “I know you’re scared. I know you can try this differently though, and aim for what you really want out of this situation.” If nothing else, you will at least give yourself the confidence to face your fears.   </p>\n\n<p>Or let’s say the situation is commitment. You notice that whenever a relationship gets to a certain point, you call it quits or get bored. Next time it happens, notice that it’s happening. Say to yourself “I know I'm scared. How can I do this differently this time though?” Make room for something different to happen by making new choices for yourself.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-29-at-12.08.24-PM-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"9learnthe5lovelanguages\">9: Learn the 5 Love Languages.</h4>\n\n<p>Lastly, this book on \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X\">The Five Languages of Love: The Secret to Love that Lasts\" by Gary Chapman</a> could completely change the way you perceive relationships. Even after I learned the names of these five languages, I realized people had been showing me love all along, but in ways I had been missing, because their natural love languages were different from mine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your primary love languages?</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Words of Affirmation  </li>\n<li>Acts of Service  </li>\n<li>Gifts  </li>\n<li>Quality Time  </li>\n<li>Physical Touch</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For example, I instantly realized the differences between my partner's primary love languages (Acts of Service, Gifts), and mine (Quality Time, Words of Affirmation). Now I understood why we kept missing each other, like ships in the night.  I also got to see the places where we were similar (Physical Affection). </p>\n\n<p>Now, when my partner cleans the kitchen or offers to pick something up for me, I realize that it's his \"Acts of Service\" way of saying \"I love you\". I also understand now why he's so appreciative of even the smallest knickknack I bring him (\"Gifts\").</p>\n\n<p>I've also learned to have more compassion and less judgment when someone seems to be withholding something.  I look instead for the other ways in which they may be giving, and become more aware of whether I'm expressing my love for them in the ways they can most appreciate them.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"insummaryhereslaurenkorshaks9tipsfornavigatingnewrelationships\">In summary, here's Lauren Korshak's 9 tips for navigating new relationships:</h5>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Love yourself first  </li>\n<li>Focus.

You've been such a big part of this for me, so much so that, if Well Connected Now was a book, I would dedicate it to you.\n\nFrom the day we met standing in line for Microsoft's Company Meeting, I loved that Alex supported mental health advocacy and enjoyed discussing psychology. Alex's grandma is a retired psychotherapist and his brother is a psychologist in training. Also a software engineer and the love of my life, Alex offers a unique perspective on starting a company. \n\nAs my confidant, roommate, and most supportive backer, Alex's story on his front row seat to entrepreneurship mirrors many other founders' significant others' experiences, although those stories aren't often told. \n\nOn that note, this one's for the unsung heroes of entrepreneurship: our significant others.\n\n####What's your perspective on the entrepreneurial rollercoaster?\n\n**Alex Andresen**: The biggest surprise for me has been how much of a roller-coaster it really is. I was expecting it to be more of a steady battle, an uphill grind, a consistent climb up to the top, but it's much more of an actual roller-coaster with real ups and downs. Things go well for a little while; then they get tough, and they could stay tough for a while too.\n\nI thought it would be more steady progress, like working for a while from milestone to milestone, which I realize now is much more like how my work has been as a non-entrepreneur. \n\nAs an entrepreneur though, there's so many things you're trying to get done, and some of those things work out and some of those don't. There's much more unexpected success too, which could also coincide with failures the day before and after. Every day seems like a new adventure.\n\nEvery day when I ask about your day, I genuinely don't know what you'll say. Sometimes you'll text me, \"Omg this great thing just happened!\" or sometimes I don't hear from you, and turns out you're bummed about a tough day. Then sometimes, you'll be jumping up and down, so excited about something that happened. Obviously, I prefer those days [Me too!], and I'm always happy to celebrate them with you.\n\n#####So, it sounds like if you were to draw the entrepreneurial rollercoaster a year ago, it would be a staircase. How would you draw it now?\n\n**Alex**: There would be ups and downs. You would go up, and then you would drop down to a point that's maybe lower then where you were at just recently, almost like the stock market. The goal is hopefully slow, long-term growth. Seeing the day to day though, one day might be worse than the whole last week.\n\nIf the company continues to be successful, as it has been, then the goal could be to zoom out, and instead of concentrating on the volatility day-to-day, focusing on the gradual, long-term trends. However, that's really abstracting away about 99% of entrepreneurship to look at it only from that macro view; it is so much more than that.\n\n####Tell me about the decision to start Well Connected Now. What was going through your mind then?\n\n**Alex**: I was super excited for you. Ever since I met you, basically, you'd been telling me that there was this idea for a company that you wanted to start. At some point, you trusted me enough to tell me what that idea actually was. \n\nThen, I saw you dealing with the difficulties of working in a corporate environment while we were at Microsoft. The whole time I knew you there, you had this idea on how to solve these problems though. \n\nSo, I was super excited to hear that you were going to go for it, and I just wanted to be there to support you however I could to allow you to go on that journey.\n\n####Were there fears or worries that you had too?\n\n**Alex**: Of course, I hoped that things were going to go well, but it's a start-up, so you just don't know what's going to happen or where life's going to take you. There are so many  things outside of your control that could impact the company, and it's tough not to take things like that personally. \n\n>It's a hard life, so of course, I also worried about how it would affect you and how your day-to-day would be. Would you be happy? \n\nBut I knew it was something you wanted to do, so I thought it was best to try - give it a shot; see what it was like. If you hate it, then you could stop, but you had this passion for a long time, so I definitely thought you should go for it, and give it a try.\n\n**Lisa**: I would've never gone for it, and given it a try, if you weren't encouraging me and taking that passion seriously. [Of course.] Not everyone's significant others react that way. \n\n####Have you dreamed of being a founder as well?\n\n**Alex**: No. I don't think I could do it; too much stress and uncertainty. You really have to have an inner drive to fix something. \n\nEven in college when we were working on projects, I was never the one that had an idea for what we should do, but I loved working with people that did have good ideas, and offering to help them. \n\n**Lisa**: It's awesome that even though entrepreneurship is not the route you would take, you've still empathized and encouraged me.\n\n**Alex**: Definitely. Yea, people are different, and I can really see that different things drive you than drive me. Different things make you happy and excited. \n\nI also didn't mind some things you disliked about your job. You really didn't like following decisions that you thought were bad. You wanted to make more decisions yourself, and take more risks. \n\n####What's surprised you about founding a company?\n\n**Alex**:  I think you gave me this quote: \"Celebrate the Victories\". That's really important, because it's not like entrepreneurship's all negatives. It's not like every day sucks. There are good days and bad days, and you have to be able to celebrate the good days, so that they can ride you through the bad days. \n\nI also had some sort of idea that if you had your own company that you had to do everything, but I feel like I understand more so what \"everything\" is now. Even though I don't know everything that you do, but each day that you say you have this and that, I think \"Wow, she has to do that too?\" You really have to do *everything*.\n\n##### What are some things you've learned about the business side, that you may have not realized before as a software engineer?\n\n**Alex**: Business seems a lot less black and white to me. When you're solving an engineering problem, yea, there's different ways to do it, but at the end, you mostly know, ok, it's working. \n\nSure, maybe sometime in the future, you find out that the design you chose wasn't as good, but you try to make every decision as best as possible, and at some point, you end up with something that's working. Then, you go on to the next thing.\n\n>With entrepreneurship and business strategy, there are no right answers. You're trying to decide between A and B, and maybe they're both fine. Or maybe they're both wrong, and you just spent all this time picking between them. You don't know, but you just have to try to do what you can with the information at hand. \n\n####How involved are you in WCN's strategy and product?\n\n**Alex**: We talk about it a lot, so I know what's typically top of mind for you. I feel like I know a lot about the critical pieces of Well Connected Now too. I also feel like I'm more of a sounding board. We'll talk it through, but it's ultimately your decision on what gets done. Oftentimes, just having a conversation out loud together seems to make next steps more clear in your mind. Often, I don't know myself, and you'll say, \"Oh! Actually, we should do it this way, and I just say \"Oh, glad I could help!\" (laughs). \n\nMaybe you'll say differently, but I don't think I'm influencing WCN's direction.  If there's something you seem to be set on that I don't think may be realistic, then yea, I'll share my thoughts. I try not to tell you what you should do with your company though. I try not to get in the way of your dreams.\n\n**Lisa**: We definitely talk through grey areas. When it comes to balancing varied perspectives, that's oftentimes when I come to you as a sounding board.\n\nYou've also helped me through some recruiting conversations, as in, you helped me spot where I was overreaching - where I was too far in my dreams of how this awesome person and I were going to take on the world together. \n\nYou'd gently remind me that this person's coming out of grad school with a hundred thousand dollars in loans, or just starting a new job they've been gunning for the last year. \n\n>You've given me reality checks on some of my ideas. You've also managed to bring them up in a kind way, such as asking me \"How do you think that's going to work exactly?\"\n\n#### On that note, what do you wish more knew about how to support entrepreneurs?\n\n**Alex**: I think this really goes back to celebrating the victories. You may have a day where you spend 90% of it slugging through things that you didn't want to work on, but then there was some good thing that happened. It could be easy to forget about that and let the good get buried.\n\nInstead, you can try and focus on the bigger picture, such as, \"I didn't like doing all those things, but: I'm so glad that that they're done; Or, but I'm so much better off now because of that; Or, but this great thing happened today too. Try to focus on the positives because there are so many negatives that it's easy to let those bog you down.  \n\n**Lisa**: So, you're saying on the days where I'm saying, \"Oh, I just spent the entire day in Quickbooks. I hate those days...\"\n\n**Alex**: I'll say, \"I'm sorry, that sucks. Sounds like a very productive day though.\" I try to put a positive spin on it. Even if it was a negative experience while you were doing it, at least it's done and you did it and now you can move on to something else. \n\n**Lisa**: Yea, oftentimes, then you ask me, \"What else did you do today?\" It forces me to remember that aside from those things sucking, I actually had a great email or consultation too. When I start off telling you the negative, you will remind me of the positive things that I forgot about the day.\n\n**Alex**: Yea, you always do a bunch of stuff, and it's very likely that at least one of those things went well.\n\n**Lisa**: That's true! \n\n####What's a good quote that keeps you going?\n\n**Alex**: \"Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment\". \n\nI think that's especially applicable in entrepreneurship, because you're going to make a ton of mistakes and that's how you get better. \n\n**Lisa**:  Any last words?\n\n**Alex**: I just want to say that I'm proud of you and what you've done with WCN. It's exciting to be a part of it, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.\n\n**Lisa**: Aww, thanks Alex!\n\n[kissing sounds]","html":"<p><strong>Lisa Abdilova</strong>: Hey Alex, [Hi Lisa!] thanks for taking the time to share what Well Connected Now's journey has been like for you.

It could be easy to forget about that and let the good get buried.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, you can try and focus on the bigger picture, such as, \"I didn't like doing all those things, but: I'm so glad that that they're done; Or, but I'm so much better off now because of that; Or, but this great thing happened today too. Try to focus on the positives because there are so many negatives that it's easy to let those bog you down.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: So, you're saying on the days where I'm saying, \"Oh, I just spent the entire day in Quickbooks. I hate those days...\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: I'll say, \"I'm sorry, that sucks. Sounds like a very productive day though.\" I try to put a positive spin on it. Even if it was a negative experience while you were doing it, at least it's done and you did it and now you can move on to something else. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Yea, oftentimes, then you ask me, \"What else did you do today?\" It forces me to remember that aside from those things sucking, I actually had a great email or consultation too. When I start off telling you the negative, you will remind me of the positive things that I forgot about the day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: Yea, you always do a bunch of stuff, and it's very likely that at least one of those things went well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: That's true! </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatsagoodquotethatkeepsyougoing\">What's a good quote that keeps you going?</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: \"Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment\". </p>\n\n<p>I think that's especially applicable in entrepreneurship, because you're going to make a ton of mistakes and that's how you get better. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong>:  Any last words?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: I just want to say that I'm proud of you and what you've done with WCN. It's exciting to be a part of it, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Aww, thanks Alex!</p>\n\n<p>[kissing
