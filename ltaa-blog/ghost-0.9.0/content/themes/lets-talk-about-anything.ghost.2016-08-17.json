to Ghost","slug":"welcome-to-ghost","markdown":"You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!\n\n> Ghost - Just a blogging platform\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.

WCN (wellconnectednow.com) is a service that personally matches professionals to mentors, coaches, and therapists. Lisa has been working on the venture for about year and a half now, and spoke candidly to us about everything from the hunt for her co-founder, to revenue milestones, to the support system who helped her take the plunge.\n\nGrowing up in the Bay Area and attending Stanford University as an undergraduate, Lisa grew up in a hotbed of entrepreneurship: “I think like a lot of twenty- and thirty-somethings do these days, I wanted to be involved with starting a business from the ground up. I wanted to create a household brand,” she said.\n\nBoth of Lisa’s parents worked in the technology space in San Francisco, and laid some initial groundwork for Lisa’s entrepreneurial pursuit. “I distinctly remember my parents coming home from work…frustrated…and [saying] ‘you need to be your own boss one day,’” she said.\n\nIn addition to her parents, a former manager at Bling — a mobile payments company — really inspired Lisa to consider her own venture. This role model, who helped launch E*TRADE, spoke about the valuable experiences she gained in the entrepreneurial process: learning rapidly, and working with people who shared the same passion. “Those were all things that I wanted,” said Lisa. “[And] it was with her stamp of approval and encouragement that I went for it [with WCN]. I went all-in.”\n\nShe does admit that “all-in” didn’t mean a full-time pursuit until a meeting with another advisor, Nate Rodland, the COO of Robinhood.\n“Nate said to me, ‘There’s no f*cking way you can build a high-growth startup while working another job full-time,’” she explained.\n\nSo, in November of 2014, Lisa left her role as a Product Marketing Manager at Microsoft to pursue WCN full-time. Without a steady salary, Lisa realized that she’d need to find support via other means. “I got a really small loan from friends and family,” she said. “You really don’t need much.”\n\nLisa had already been thinking about the concept of WCN for about a year. “It was a long-time in the making. I just saw too many people who had been struggling, and I know how effective therapy can be for people,” she said. “I also know that therapists and coaches can give a lot of priceless knowledge and encouragement to people in tough times.\n\n>*“I wish that there was more of a resource that people could call when their manager isn’t treating them right or they just got a bad review. I want people to have a place that they can call and get trustworthy support, wherever they are on the spectrum of dissatisfaction — whether that’s them wanting a new role or wanting to get their life together, or whether it’s getting a little darker than that.”*\n\nAt Microsoft, Lisa found avenues to explore these passions, coaching mentees from the Microsoft Academy of College Hires, but wanted to pursue the problem of mental health more aggressively. “It didn’t feel like enough,” she said. “70% of people struggling with depression and anxiety don’t seek treatment today. My dream is that one day, that percentage will be significantly lower, and that we can say that WCN had a direct impact in lowering that number.”\n\n![Lisa Abdilova’s first mental health advocacy campaign at Stanford #FightTheStigma](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZwyxU31-wZXHeegrSBM1GQ.jpeg)\n\nLisa graduated with a degree in Psychology and Science, Technology, and Society from Stanford in 2011. She relies a great deal on her degree in building out partnerships for her venture: “As I schmooze with all of these therapists, it really helps that I can walk the walk and quote different studies and recognize the big-name therapists,” she said. However, Science, Technology, and Society is not a degree in Computer Science, which accounted for a skill gap in Lisa’s plan to run her business through an online storefront. “They always tell you to find a partner,” she said. “Any tech blog or any accelerator will encourage you to have a co-founder, especially if you’re not a developer.”\n\nWhile conducting the search for a co-founder, Lisa enrolled in a web design course through General Assembly to keep her plan in motion. And despite searching for a partner for six months, had trouble landing the perfect co-founder. Lisa recollected Nate’s assessment of her search: “At this point, we’re over six months in. The idea is running. The website’s up. You have clients in…\n\n###“You’re a solo founder whether you like it or not.”\nAlthough there have been some technical hurdles for Lisa, she feels confident in her role as a solo founder, particularly when thinking about company ownership. Having dedicated over a year of her life to this project, the concept of handing significant equity to someone who hasn’t been along for the journey feels backwards. “It’s not about credit, it’s about the mission,” she said. “[But] it’s not fair if one person is doing significantly more work than the other.”\nWe dug into this more toward the end of our interview. When posed with the question “if you had to do it all over again, what would you change?” Lisa’s response pivoted around getting the right people invested and onboard before taking the plunge: “I would gather my team first, and leave all together. It’s hard being the first person to start a company, and it’s really hard to be the second person to decide to join.”\nTruth be told, Lisa is not completely solo in her venture. She is supported by a team of six advisors with whom she has formalized contracts and advising terms. “The goal was for each advisor to supplement my skill set,” she said. Her mix of advisors ranges from former employers (“They know what you’re capable of.”), to more seasoned entrepreneurs (“They just know exactly what you need to know and how to do it.”), to technical and telehealth professionals. Lisa shared a piece of advice that someone had formerly given her when figuring out who to team up with:\n“With investors and advisors, if they called you, would you want to pick up?”\nIn addition to leveraging her advisors’ knowledge, Lisa explained that she’s learning on her own at an incredibly rapid pace. “[The reality of the entrepreneurial experience is that] something comes up that you have to figure out. And you have the opportunity — because you dictate your own time — to spend the next day reading everything you possibly can about it,” she said. “And then you get to put what you learn into motion. Or you find people to help you fill in the gaps or clarify the things you don’t understand. You really do learn a ridiculous amount.”\nTo supplement her background in marketing, Lisa enrolled in a program that matches entrepreneurs with Stanford business school students, who help build out business plans and advise on fundraising strategy. After three months of meetings, Lisa had a 20-page plan, complete with financial models, which she sent along to her advisors. Her advisors thought the document was comical — no one reads 20-page documents anymore — and suggested that she turn the information into a pitch deck and an executive summary (code for a well-designed flier, which Lisa later learned). A marketing intern also helped Lisa perform SWOT analysis, and identify different competitors in the space. Indirect competitors (who are getting the largest amount of funding) are establishing business-to-business telehealth offerings, setting up deals with insurance companies or employer assistance programs.\n“We’re really focused on direct-to-consumer,” Lisa explained. “Our clients are ones that don’t want this to have anything to do with their company. In a lot of cases, they don’t want this to have anything to do with their insurance company. They could lose their jobs if [use of this type of mental health assistance] ever got out.”\nPutting this rigor around her business plan was really important to Lisa. “So many startups are just smoke and mirrors. They’re not actually making money,” she said. “So many startups are operating at such huge losses and really high valuations. I’m very committed to building WCN out in a real business sense.” She also realizes that running a service means continuously acting on end user data to optimize her profitability. “I’m going back into [my business plan] now that we have a year’s worth of real revenue and real cost data,” she explained, “to figure out where we can make some tweaks to make the largest impact without affecting the quality of service to our clients or the specialists that we partner with.”\nIn Lisa’s last role at Microsoft, she sponsored meet-ups in the Seattle and San Francisco tech scenes. As a newly-minted entrepreneur, she returned to these meet-ups to drive awareness of WCN: “You might remember me — I left Microsoft to start a company!” Lisa explained that these brief presentations prompted attendees to approach her to learn more. “That’s where a lot of our first clients came from,” she explained. “We made our first match about two months after [I left Microsoft to start the company].” To acquire more users and build up word-of-mouth potential, Lisa offered first 100 matches for free.\nLisa matched those first 100 clients manually, by learning about each client, really understanding his or her needs, and then providing a white glove handoff to a coach, therapist, or mentor. The manual validation was the quickest way to set WCN in motion, but Lisa admits that searching for specialists was (and still is) a time suck. She’s in the process of building all of her acquired matching knowledge into an algorithm with a directory of specialists to avoid the pain point moving forward. In the meantime, she’s finding ways to cut corners and make the most of precious hours — even if it’s just copy/pasting email templates.\n“Anything I was doing repeatedly…I tried to find a way to automate it,” she explained “Everything gets faster every time.”\nDriven by a mission, Lisa explained that the concept of WCN has stayed very constant since kickoff in November 2014. “We’re doing the same thing that we were doing from the beginning. I would say that our scope has gotten a little tighter,” she explained. According to Lisa, her pilot phase was an exercise in market segmentation. “Originally, when there were free matches, a lot of people were reaching out to [have introductions made]. [Those introductions] weren’t tied into the mission of helping people with real challenges. Those people were just looking for transactional things — a job, things like that,” she said.\n“Our mission is to rebrand mental health and to make trustworthy support more accessible. [WCN] is not meant to just facilitate introductions; it’s much more than that.”\nThere has been one interesting pivot that Lisa called out in her venture to date: “In the beginning, I thought that [telehealth] would be a big part of [WCN]. We were going to build the best technology for therapists to do teletherapy,” she said. However, at the urging of one of her advisors, Lisa decided to leave the means of communication open to end users, and surveyed her initial clients. “We found that over 90% of our clients prefer meeting in-person. That’s something that our competitors don’t realize yet. [Telehealth] is a cool idea, but people prefer meeting therapists and mentors in-person,” she said. This realization proved to be a key learning from a strategic and investment perspective. “What that pivot meant is that we’re not going to invest in building our own video chat technology,” said Lisa. “There’s a number of companies that do that, and they’ll take care of all of these complexities that now we don’t need to touch because we realize that it’s not actually core to the business.”\n\nLisa’s most recent #SideWalkTalk in downtown San Francisco #FightTheStigma\nWith just over a year of WCN under her belt, there have already been a few celebratory milestones for Lisa and her team. “I distinctly remember emailing my advisors at three different points: our first transaction, the first big transaction, and when we broke $1000 in revenue,” she said. “That felt like real money to me. It didn’t feel like real money to me when I was managing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a marketing budget at Microsoft. But now, I’m going to start running my paid marketing campaigns, and I can barely part with $25.”\nFor Lisa, there’s no acquisition play or get-rich-quick plan when it comes to WCN. She relayed her vision for what long-term success would look like:\n“WCN [would be] the go-to resource for 20- and 30-something professionals to consult throughout their careers…\nWe would have this great office in the tech hub in Seattle and San Francisco and have the best set of pre-screened therapists and coaches and mentoring programs. Expansion, continued personal involvement and control, and freedom to test her ideas are the markers of a true payoff for Lisa in this venture.”\n—\nWell Connected Now personally matches professionals to mentors, coaches, and therapists — letstalkaboutanything.com","html":"<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E-HMLDji8g4k3Oue6qOGRw.jpeg\" alt=\"Well Connected Now Founder/CEO Lisa Abdilova #FightTheStigma\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to University of Washington’s Foster School of Business Technology Management MBA program, more specifically: <strong>Colleen O’Brien, Samuel Affolter, Debmalya Chandra, Parker Keegan, and Rahul Tulsyan</strong> for your powerful summary of our Jan 2016 entrepreneurship interview.</em></p>\n\n<p>\"We recently interviewed Lisa Abdilova, Colleen’s friend and former colleague, and the founder of Well Connected now (WCN).

Without a steady salary, Lisa realized that she’d need to find support via other means. “I got a really small loan from friends and family,” she said. “You really don’t need much.”</p>\n\n<p>Lisa had already been thinking about the concept of WCN for about a year. “It was a long-time in the making. I just saw too many people who had been struggling, and I know how effective therapy can be for people,” she said. “I also know that therapists and coaches can give a lot of priceless knowledge and encouragement to people in tough times.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“I wish that there was more of a resource that people could call when their manager isn’t treating them right or they just got a bad review. I want people to have a place that they can call and get trustworthy support, wherever they are on the spectrum of dissatisfaction — whether that’s them wanting a new role or wanting to get their life together, or whether it’s getting a little darker than that.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At Microsoft, Lisa found avenues to explore these passions, coaching mentees from the Microsoft Academy of College Hires, but wanted to pursue the problem of mental health more aggressively. “It didn’t feel like enough,” she said. “70% of people struggling with depression and anxiety don’t seek treatment today. My dream is that one day, that percentage will be significantly lower, and that we can say that WCN had a direct impact in lowering that number.”</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZwyxU31-wZXHeegrSBM1GQ.jpeg\" alt=\"Lisa Abdilova’s first mental health advocacy campaign at Stanford #FightTheStigma\" /></p>\n\n<p>Lisa graduated with a degree in Psychology and Science, Technology, and Society from Stanford in 2011. She relies a great deal on her degree in building out partnerships for her venture: “As I schmooze with all of these therapists, it really helps that I can walk the walk and quote different studies and recognize the big-name therapists,” she said. However, Science, Technology, and Society is not a degree in Computer Science, which accounted for a skill gap in Lisa’s plan to run her business through an online storefront. “They always tell you to find a partner,” she said. “Any tech blog or any accelerator will encourage you to have a co-founder, especially if you’re not a developer.”</p>\n\n<p>While conducting the search for a co-founder, Lisa enrolled in a web design course through General Assembly to keep her plan in motion. And despite searching for a partner for six months, had trouble landing the perfect co-founder. Lisa recollected Nate’s assessment of her search: “At this point, we’re over six months in. The idea is running. The website’s up. You have clients in…</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"youreasolofounderwhetheryoulikeitornot\">“You’re a solo founder whether you like it or not.”</h3>\n\n<p>Although there have been some technical hurdles for Lisa, she feels confident in her role as a solo founder, particularly when thinking about company ownership. Having dedicated over a year of her life to this project, the concept of handing significant equity to someone who hasn’t been along for the journey feels backwards. “It’s not about credit, it’s about the mission,” she said. “[But] it’s not fair if one person is doing significantly more work than the other.” <br />\nWe dug into this more toward the end of our interview. When posed with the question “if you had to do it all over again, what would you change?” Lisa’s response pivoted around getting the right people invested and onboard before taking the plunge: “I would gather my team first, and leave all together. It’s hard being the first person to start a company, and it’s really hard to be the second person to decide to join.” <br />\nTruth be told, Lisa is not completely solo in her venture. She is supported by a team of six advisors with whom she has formalized contracts and advising terms. “The goal was for each advisor to supplement my skill set,” she said. Her mix of advisors ranges from former employers (“They know what you’re capable of.”), to more seasoned entrepreneurs (“They just know exactly what you need to know and how to do it.”), to technical and telehealth professionals. Lisa shared a piece of advice that someone had formerly given her when figuring out who to team up with: <br />\n“With investors and advisors, if they called you, would you want to pick up?”\nIn addition to leveraging her advisors’ knowledge, Lisa explained that she’s learning on her own at an incredibly rapid pace. “[The reality of the entrepreneurial experience is that] something comes up that you have to figure out. And you have the opportunity — because you dictate your own time — to spend the next day reading everything you possibly can about it,” she said. “And then you get to put what you learn into motion. Or you find people to help you fill in the gaps or clarify the things you don’t understand. You really do learn a ridiculous amount.” <br />\nTo supplement her background in marketing, Lisa enrolled in a program that matches entrepreneurs with Stanford business school students, who help build out business plans and advise on fundraising strategy. After three months of meetings, Lisa had a 20-page plan, complete with financial models, which she sent along to her advisors. Her advisors thought the document was comical — no one reads 20-page documents anymore — and suggested that she turn the information into a pitch deck and an executive summary (code for a well-designed flier, which Lisa later learned). A marketing intern also helped Lisa perform SWOT analysis, and identify different competitors in the space. Indirect competitors (who are getting the largest amount of funding) are establishing business-to-business telehealth offerings, setting up deals with insurance companies or employer assistance programs. <br />\n“We’re really focused on direct-to-consumer,” Lisa explained. “Our clients are ones that don’t want this to have anything to do with their company. In a lot of cases, they don’t want this to have anything to do with their insurance company. They could lose their jobs if [use of this type of mental health assistance] ever got out.”\nPutting this rigor around her business plan was really important to Lisa. “So many startups are just smoke and mirrors. They’re not actually making money,” she said. “So many startups are operating at such huge losses and really high valuations. I’m very committed to building WCN out in a real business sense.” She also realizes that running a service means continuously acting on end user data to optimize her profitability. “I’m going back into [my business plan] now that we have a year’s worth of real revenue and real cost data,” she explained, “to figure out where we can make some tweaks to make the largest impact without affecting the quality of service to our clients or the specialists that we partner with.” <br />\nIn Lisa’s last role at Microsoft, she sponsored meet-ups in the Seattle and San Francisco tech scenes. As a newly-minted entrepreneur, she returned to these meet-ups to drive awareness of WCN: “You might remember me — I left Microsoft to start a company!” Lisa explained that these brief presentations prompted attendees to approach her to learn more. “That’s where a lot of our first clients came from,” she explained. “We made our first match about two months after [I left Microsoft to start the company].” To acquire more users and build up word-of-mouth potential, Lisa offered first 100 matches for free. <br />\nLisa matched those first 100 clients manually, by learning about each client, really understanding his or her needs, and then providing a white glove handoff to a coach, therapist, or mentor. The manual validation was the quickest way to set WCN in motion, but Lisa admits that searching for specialists was (and still is) a time suck. She’s in the process of building all of her acquired matching knowledge into an algorithm with a directory of specialists to avoid the pain point moving forward. In the meantime, she’s finding ways to cut corners and make the most of precious hours — even if it’s just copy/pasting email templates. <br />\n“Anything I was doing repeatedly…I tried to find a way to automate it,” she explained “Everything gets faster every time.”\nDriven by a mission, Lisa explained that the concept of WCN has stayed very constant since kickoff in November 2014. “We’re doing the same thing that we were doing from the beginning. I would say that our scope has gotten a little tighter,” she explained. According to Lisa, her pilot phase was an exercise in market segmentation. “Originally, when there were free matches, a lot of people were reaching out to [have introductions made]. [Those introductions] weren’t tied into the mission of helping people with real challenges. Those people were just looking for transactional things — a job, things like that,” she said. <br />\n“Our mission is to rebrand mental health and to make trustworthy support more accessible. [WCN] is not meant to just facilitate introductions; it’s much more than that.”\nThere has been one interesting pivot that Lisa called out in her venture to date: “In the beginning, I thought that [telehealth] would be a big part of [WCN]. We were going to build the best technology for therapists to do teletherapy,” she said. However, at the urging of one of her advisors, Lisa decided to leave the means of communication open to end users, and surveyed her initial clients. “We found that over 90% of our clients prefer meeting in-person. That’s something that our competitors don’t realize yet. [Telehealth] is a cool idea, but people prefer meeting therapists and mentors in-person,” she said. This realization proved to be a key learning from a strategic and investment perspective. “What that pivot meant is that we’re not going to invest in building our own video chat technology,” said Lisa. “There’s a number of companies that do that, and they’ll take care of all of these complexities that now we don’t need to touch because we realize that it’s not actually core to the business.”</p>\n\n<p>Lisa’s most recent #SideWalkTalk in downtown San Francisco #FightTheStigma <br />\nWith just over a year of WCN under her belt, there have already been a few celebratory milestones for Lisa and her team. “I distinctly remember emailing my advisors at three different points: our first transaction, the first big transaction, and when we broke $1000 in revenue,” she said. “That felt like real money to me. It didn’t feel like real money to me when I was managing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a marketing budget at Microsoft. But now, I’m going to start running my paid marketing campaigns, and I can barely part with $25.” <br />\nFor Lisa, there’s no acquisition play or get-rich-quick plan when it comes to WCN. She relayed her vision for what long-term success would look like: <br />\n“WCN [would be] the go-to resource for 20- and 30-something professionals to consult throughout their careers…\nWe would have this great office in the tech hub in Seattle and San Francisco and have the best set of pre-screened therapists and coaches and mentoring programs. Expansion, continued personal involvement and control, and freedom to test her ideas are the markers of a true payoff for Lisa in this venture.” <br />\n—\nWell Connected Now personally matches professionals to mentors, coaches, and therapists — letstalkaboutanything.com</p>","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E-HMLDji8g4k3Oue6qOGRw.jpeg","featured":1,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-04-26T16:25:15.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-04-26T22:37:24.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-03-10T20:35:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null},{"id":5,"uuid":"d6758141-f64c-407a-bc44-66c494ec9298","title":"Parenting - MS Ventures","slug":"parenting-ms-ventures","markdown":"","html":"","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-04-26T16:26:18.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-04-26T16:26:21.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":null,"published_by":null,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null},{"id":6,"uuid":"1a86f150-16e9-4352-9221-6fda7a0c753c","title":"How Mentors, Coaches, and Therapists Support You","slug":"how-mentors-coaches-and-therapists-support-you","markdown":"","html":"","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-04-26T16:27:10.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-04-26T16:27:13.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":null,"published_by":null,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null},{"id":7,"uuid":"fe1c1540-3aff-4005-ab19-3335cbd2223b","title":"Starting Up Outside of Silicon Valley","slug":"starting-up-outside-of-silicon-valley","markdown":"","html":"","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-04-26T16:27:34.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-04-26T16:27:34.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":null,"published_by":null,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null},{"id":8,"uuid":"08837088-5594-410e-a854-95fd0541621e","title":"Where you should start-up?

That much is clear. What’s not so clear is who you should ask for help: a mentor, a career coach, or maybe even a therapist?\n\nTrust me, you’re not the first person to struggle with this conundrum.\n\nAfter studying Psychology & Science, Technology & Society at Stanford, coaching Microsoft's Academy of College Hires, and marketing consumer apps around the world as a Tech Evangelist, I saw too many friends, co-workers, and mentees struggle with unsupportive managers and underwhelming roles. So much so that I founded a company with a mission to rebrand mental health, and make trustworthy support more accessible, especially for 20-30 something professionals and entrepreneurs striving for more life and career satisfaction.\n\nUnfortunately, too many struggle privately for far too long and end up feeling stuck, or worse, spiraling downward. For too many reasons, people don’t give enough credit to the incredible strength it takes to reveal your concerns and ask for more support.\n\nBlind referrals, difficulties scheduling, and incompatible matches have also made finding professional support unnecessarily harder for too many people in vulnerable times.\n\nWhile I can’t jump inside your head and make the decision for you on whether to reach out for more support, I can provide you with information that’ll help you get there on your own.\n\n\n\nWhen You Should Talk to a Mentor\n\nIf you’re just starting to feel like something might be off, a mentor could shed light on how your experience compares to other companies or roles in your industry. An outside perspective can help you learn from other people’s mistakes, experiences, and professional training. Mentors also blend professionalism and authenticity in ways that not only lead to smarter business, life, and career decisions, but also often open doors for you once you’ve risen above your challenges.\n\nFor example, when Kelly*, a consumer technology marketer wanted advice on navigating her career and getting past an unsupportive manager, she wished she could privately consult someone more experienced, senior, and familiar with her company culture. Since confidentiality can be such a grey area at work, she also preferred to talk with someone outside of her organization.\n\nKelly’s mentor met with her monthly and encouraged her to realize her full potential, despite her challenges. Armed with a trustworthy confidant fluent in reading between the lines of corporate emails and disappointing management, Kelly’s self-confidence and drive super-charged.\n\nAlthough your life can change after one 45-minute mentoring call, mentors typically volunteer to \"stop by\" monthly or so to discuss interesting challenges you’re facing and brainstorm your career steps.\n\nJust two notes: Because you’re likely going to try to impress your mentor, you’re more likely to downplay potential issues. So, be aware of that if you’re entering into this type of relationship. Also keep in mind that as awesome as a mentor can be, finding just the right person who shares your values and ambitions, plus cares enough to support you takes time.\n\n\n\nWhen You Should Talk to a Coach\n\nCoaches, on the other hand, aren’t typically tied to potential job opportunities and don’t often share professional contacts with you. They also don’t have any conflicts of interest when they’re hired individually. So, if you’re looking to consult someone weekly or every other week with fewer strings attached, this could be a better option.\n\nYou can think of these people as supportive cheerleaders. They can empower you to achieve your goals through action-oriented tips and tricks, train you on new skill sets, assist you with your job search, do negotiation role play, and even help you get through those tricky situations in the office.\n\nWhen Matt* struggled to find an engineering job after finishing a coding boot camp, for example, a resume and interview coach offered him actionable strategies on positioning his experience more confidently. Throughout this process, Matt wanted a constructive, independent appraisal from a former engineering hiring manager (not more friends or family), and that’s exactly what this coach provided.\n\nReady for the downside? This option can be expensive, since coaches often have significant industry or entrepreneurial experience and charge accordingly. They’re also not covered by health insurance.\n\n\n\nWhen You Should Talk to a Therapist\n\nWhile coaches focus more on optimistic, forward-facing business and career challenges, therapists concentrate on more of the personal core beliefs potentially holding you back.\n\nThe longer you’ve been unsatisfied, the less optimistic you might be. When negativity and frustrations are left unaddressed for too long, physical “stress-induced” pains start getting louder too, and your body’s alarms signal for things to change.\n\nAlthough therapists typically can’t offer as much business guidance or career-planning advice as coaches or mentors do, most specialize in helping you when you’re:\n\nFeeling stressed and overwhelmed\nHaving trouble sleeping, socializing, relaxing, or focusing\nNoticing changes in your appetite, hygiene, or lifestyle\nExperiencing back, neck, or shoulder pain as well as muscle tension\nStruggling with unusually low self-confidence\nHaving trouble connecting with other people\nSpiraling into potential signs of depression or anxiety\nWhen Michael*, a software engineer, struggled with some of these early signs of depression, he knew it was time to speak to someone who specialized in the topic. He’d struggled with low energy, self-defeating thoughts, insomnia, and high irritability for months already. He was sick of it. This wasn’t him. He was ready for a change.\n\nAfter just a couple sessions, Michael shared that the experience made him realize that he wasn’t clinically depressed, but rather just needed to quit his job. His company’s hiring bar had significantly dropped, and he was left to pick up the team’s slack. Without many teammates left to consult or learn from, he found himself demotivated and increasingly more resistant to taking on more work.\n\nAfter seeing a therapist, he realized his frustrations centered around needing to break free. Michael explained, “I realized there’s nothing actually wrong with me...They can keep asking me to stay, but I am going to travel the world like I’ve always wanted.”\n\nAs far as costs go, therapists really range depending on where you’re located and what your insurance deductible is. However, many offer sliding scale rates, which means they are open to negotiating their bill rate, especially if you’re going out of network or truly can’t afford it.\n\n\n\nFight the Stigma\n\nMy dream is that one day, people will feel more comfortable asking for help when they need it—because it actually takes great strength and vulnerability to realize you can't get where you want to go in your life or career on your own.\n\nAsk any successful person how he or she got there, and you’ll almost always hear about someone who opened a door, offered advice, or gave a necessary confidence boost at a critical time.\n\nSo, now that you’re armed with all this info, give a mentor, coach, or therapist a try.\n\n\n\n*Please note that some names and other identifying details have been altered to protect the confidentiality of our clients.\n\n*Originally posted on The Daily Muse - https://www.themuse.com/advice/mentors-career-coaches-and-therapists-which-ones-best-to-get-you-out-of-your-rut","html":"<p>So, you’re having a problem navigating a tricky situation at the office and you know you need help figuring it out.

These books have helped me grow into someone that my family, close friends, and my younger self can be proud of, and I hope they can help you in a similar way.\n\n1. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen Covey\nIn this landmark book, Stephen Covey introduces the concept of the Abundance Mindset as opposed to the Scarcity Mindset. He very convincingly explains that success in business and in life is not achieved through an “I win, they lose” mentality. True prosperity comes in delivering value to others at the highest possible level and by doing so, you win. In my opinion, this argument dispels the myth that the wealthy get where they are through theft, greed, and manipulation. For the most part, they get there by delivering unmatched quality of products or services, and having a “win/win” mentality. Those who are successful celebrate the achievements and prosperity of others, as opposed to being envious or jealous. Another concept of the book that particularly resonated with me is the time management quadrant. This really clarified my own life for me and made me question how much of my time I was spending in time-wasting, entertainment focused activities, as opposed to activities that will enrich my life and bring me closer to the type of life that I desired.\n\n2. Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill\nWhen Napoleon Hill was a young journalist he met Andrew Carnegie, who took an interest in him and gave him the following idea for a project: to create THE philosophy for success and achievement. This book would consume the next 25 years of Hill’s life as he interviewed and shadowed some of the world’s most successful men, including Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, and Charles Schwab, just to name a few. The book introduced several timeless principles that are still utilized by many people today. \n\nOne of the most important is bringing together a mastermind group of people who are much smarter and have certain expertise you don’t have to work towards achieving your personal and shared goals. This book also concentrates on developing a positive mindset. Hill shows how you can achieve what you want in life through strong, bulletproof desire, actively filtering out negative thoughts, and working persistently towards your goals.\n\n3. The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment - Eckhart Tolle\nThis powerful book can change your life after the first read. Tolle explains that the past and the future are illusions created by the ego, and could be the source for all the pain and suffering in our lives. You may spend the majority of your time thinking about what has happened to you in the past (mostly bad stuff), or what might happen to you in the future (again, mostly bad stuff).  Then your brain will keep creating explanations, judgments, and plans. You miss out on the realities of the present moment when you’re stuck in the past and future like that though. You may miss out on your own life, because you continue sleepwalking in this dream state of mostly self-deprecating negative thoughts. When you’re spending your day off with your family, you’re thinking about what’s going to go wrong at work next week, and when you’re at work, you’re dreaming about being able to spend a day off with your family -- you never have peace. What Tolle teaches is certainly not new. Buddhism has taught the concept of present moment awareness through meditation for thousands of years, but what Tolle has done has taken this concept and thrown it in your face persuasively and clearly enough so that you actually understand “The Power of Now” enough to practice it.\n\n\n4. Rich Dad Poor Dad\n\nAlthough my Russian Jewish immigrant parents ingrained many of the principles in this book for me already, this book wrote out and so validated what I suspected most of my life. Save more money than you spend. Invest it in assets that will grow in value, and generate income for you. Become the investor/owner, not the employee. Being an employee could just be a temporary situation until you save and invest enough money to buy the company. I saw plenty of my relatives who came to this country with no money in their pocket, well into their 30’s and 40’s, and became wealthy in as little as 5 to 10 years without even speaking English, much less having a college degree. They persistently hustled day in and day out, lived well below their means, and invested as often and as much as they could. This book has still benefited me greatly as it could for anyone else who reads it. Especially if you didn’t do so well in high school or followed a nontraditional path around college, your life is not over, you can still become very wealthy. In fact, in certain respects, you have an advantage over many of those who did go to college. I’m not going to spoil the book for you, so you have to read it and discover the reasons for yourself. \n\n5.Steve Jobs - Walter Isaacson\nThere’s one of two takeaways you’ll get from reading this book. #1 Steve Jobs was very lucky. He was born in the right place, at the right time. #2 Steve Jobs was one of the hardest working people the world has ever known. He had laser focused vision and discipline to accomplish his objectives. He didn’t deviate one bit from what he knew was right. It was his strong, yet charming personality and unwavering sense of confidence that changed the world. No, this book is not technically a self improvement book; however, it does teach us an important lesson about an average Joe, who was plagued with disadvantages early in his life, lived as a hippy, dropped acid, and dropped out of college, only to become, arguably, one of the most important figures in the history of human progress. If you wish to become great, you must study greatness, and there isn’t much better you can get than the man who created iTunes and the iPhone. Walter Isaacson is also a phenomenal writer and wrote outstanding biographies about Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin as well.\n\n6. Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life - Maxwell Maltz\nAfter several decades as a plastic surgeon, Maxwell Maltz discovered that what many of his patients really needed wasn’t a plastic surgery, but a mental makeover. He observed patients that came to his office with horrific scars, who were shy, timid, anxiety prone worriers, and after he successfully removed their scars, it was almost like they became a confident adventurer with a newly-found enthusiasm for life. While others that he operated on, no matter how “normal” they looked, kept thinking something was wrong with them and preventing them from truly being happy. It was then that he sought to research the psychology involved with the way people see themselves, and how it affects their lives. One of the most important takeaways of this book is the power of visualization. How do you see yourself in your mind’s eye? Maltz theorized that the way you visualize yourself in your mind, is the way you will inevitably become. You must make it a constant habit to picture yourself as already being the person that you want to be. If you have a job interview coming up, actively imagine yourself impressing the interviewer with your confidence and charisma. Picture yourself answering all their questions with ease, in a state of relaxation. You see, the physical body does not know the difference between reality and something vividly imagined. So you can literally create your own reality through the use of these powerful visualization techniques.\n\n7. Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand\nNow let’s ignore that this book has a very strong political message throughout the text. Let’s also try to forget that it’s more than 1,200 pages in length. This book’s real power is in changing the way you understand the moral obligation you have in becoming the best possible person you can. One thing that this book teaches that even the most ardent political opponent of Randian philosophy must agree with is that human progress does not come about automatically. Our advancements in society have come through a culmination of individual effort. After all, society is simply just a term used to describe a collection of individuals. What this book will teach you is that you as an individual have the power to change the lives of countless people in a positive way. Through your own, seemingly selfish, pursuit of being the best you can possibly be, you become more valuable to others. You create better products and services that others need. And you, as an individual, are a vital piece in the advancement of human civilization. If Steve Jobs were not born, computers and phones would not be the same as we know them today. This is true of many of the world’s greatest innovations that have helped to eliminate poverty and suffering on a major scale. Remember, that you as an individual have the power to change the world, but there’s no way you can do that if you don’t understand just how important you really are, and you don’t work your butt off every single day to realize your potential.\n\n---\n\n“If you’re not growing, then you’re dying” warns a popular quote. \n\nProgress is the theme of human evolution. Life is about transformation. Whether we like it or not, today is different from yesterday, and tomorrow will be different from today. Nothing is static and the world continues to change. \n\nAre you reacting to these changes with fear, worry, anxiety, anger, self-doubt, or envy? \n\nHow can you counteract those natural tendencies with more confidence and enthusiasm?\n\nTry reading or listening[audible links] to one of these books for more self-improvement tips.”\n","html":"<p>The fundamental misunderstanding people seem to have about “self-help” is that something needs to be wrong with you if you’re searching for how to help yourself.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, successful and well-established people often devote themselves to the pursuit of self-improvement in most aspects of their life, including health, fitness, career advancement, and even spiritual enlightenment.</p>\n\n<p>The most successful people (and this doesn’t just mean economically successful) constantly strive to become better versions of themselves.
